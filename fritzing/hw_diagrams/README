Directory for creating HW diagrams: square images used in the header of project
in the projects guide.

To create new diagrams using fritzing, if appilcable:
    - Create diagram in fritzing and export as svg.  SVG becomes original source.
    - SVG filename should be of the form "hw_blablah.svg"
    - Edit SVG if needed.
    - Add SVG to mkpngs,
    - Run "sh mkpngs" to rebuild and move all,
    - Filename, name and description must be added to hw_types in im/project.js.

Diagrams can be created without fritzing as well.
