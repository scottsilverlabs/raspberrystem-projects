  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The next group of projects are all based around the game Minecraft, with
  the goal of allowing you to create and modify your own Minecraft controller.
  If you're not familiar with it, Minecraft is a video game where you construct
  and deconstruct various 3D worlds. Unlike many video games where there is a
  specific goal (get through levels, rescue the princess, etc), in Minecraft
  the goal is generally just to explore and have fun. The basic explore/create
  mode of the game is called "creative" mode. There is also a "survival" mode,
  where the game requires the user to find food, avoid angry mobs and keep from
  being attacked by various creators. But, many players find that simply
  creating and recreating their virtual world is challenge enough and stick
  with creative mode.</p>

  <p>The Raspberry Pi comes preloaded with a simplified version of Minecraft
  tailored to the Raspberry Pi. It runs in creative mode only and has a custom
  API for editing the world and editing the the functionality inherent in you
  Minecraft character. Both single and multiplayer modes are supported. With
  the API you can create programs that interact with both your electronics AND
  the minecraft world. The next group of projects is geared towards allowing
  you to create and build your own Minecraft controller and then write the code
  to give your controller whatever functionality you wish.</p>
  <h2>Running Minecraft</h2>

  <p>In order to do your custom Minecraft programming with the RaspberrySTEM
  kit, you'll typically do the following steps (which we'll discuss in more
  detail below):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>Exit this RDE to get to the Raspberry Pi desktop</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Start Minecraft</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Minimize Minecraft</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Return to the RDE</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Write and run your code from the RDE</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

      IMPORTANT NOTE: EXITING MINECRAFT
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>Before you read any further, we have an important note that you're
      going to want to keep in mind as you run Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi.
      Every time you start Minecraft, you're eventually going to want to exit
      the game to get back to the RDE, but the game will take over the screen,
      the keyboard and the mouse while you're playing.</p>

      <p><b>In order to get control of your keyboard/mouse back from the
      Minecraft game you need to press the "TAB" button on your
      keyboard.</b></p>

      <p>This will then allow you to click on the menu items (minimize, exit)
      in the Minecraft window.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Step #1: Exit this RDE to get to the Raspberry Pi desktop</h3>

  <p>To get to the Raspberry Pi Desktop, you need to type CTRL-ALT-D (press the
  CTRL key, the ALT key and the letter D on the keyboard all at the same time).
  This will bring you to the "desktop," which looks like this:</p><img src=
  "img/mc_desktop_empty.png" alt="">
  <h3>Step #2: Start Minecraft</h3>

  <p>Once on the Raspberry Pi Desktop, you open Minecraft by clicking on "Menu"
  in the upper left corner of the desktop, clicking on "Games" and then
  clicking on "Minecraft" -- like this:</p><img src="img/mc_open_minecraft.png"
  alt="">

  <p>To begin using Minecraft, first click the "Start Game" button from the
  main window:</p><img src="img/mc_start_game.png" alt="">

  <p>Then click "Create new" to create a new world and start
  playing:</p><img src="img/mc_create_new.png" alt="">

  <p>You're now playing Minecraft! The keyboard and mouse will control your
  player, named "Steve."</p><img src="img/mc_playing.png" alt="">
  <h3>Step #3: Minimize Minecraft</h3>

  <p>While you can continue to play Minecraft without any modifications, we
  think you'll have a lot more fun (and learn a lot more!) by using the
  RaspberrySTEM kit to program and modify the Minecraft world. To do that,
  you'll write programs using the RaspberrySTEM RDE -- just like we've been
  doing in all our previous projects. In order to get back to the RDE to start
  writing your programs, you'll first need to minimize the Minecraft
  window.</p>

  <p>To do this, you'll need to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>Press the "TAB" key on the keyboard. This will free the mouse up so
      that it can be used to control the mouse cursor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Then, click the minimize button in the upper right corner of the
      window.</p>
    </li>
  </ul><img src="img/mc_desktop_empty_mc_running.png" alt="">
  <h3>Step #4: Return to the RDE</h3>

  <p>Once the Minecraft window is minimized, to return to the RDE, you'll click
  on the minimized RaspberrySTEM window icon at the top of the screen. You're
  now back in the RDE.</p>
  <h3>Step #5: Write and run your code from the RDE</h3>

  <p>Now that Minecraft is running in the background in a minimize window, it's
  time to start writing your custom Minecraft code. Let's jump into our first
  Minecraft project to get an idea of how that will work...</p>
