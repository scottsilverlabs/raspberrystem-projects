      In this project, we continue the development of our Simon-like pattern
      matching game by starting to write the game code.

  <p>In our last project, we finished wiring up the four LEDs and tested to
  verify they work. Assuming your buttons and LEDs are all working correctly,
  we've now completed the hardware for our Simon-like game.</p>

  <p>So, let's jump in to that code writing.</p>

  <p>To start programming our game, the first thing we want to do is learn how
  to flash a sequence of LEDs, as this will be the basis for the entire game.
  For this project, we'll start slow and just use a pre-defined list to create
  a planned sequence of LED flashes. For the next project, we'll expand on that
  by making the flashing sequence random.</p>
  <h2>Programming Implementation</h2>

  <p>The first thing we're going to need to do is to import the modules and
  functions we'll be using and initialize our list of LEDs. Here's what our
  initialization code should look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The sequence of LED flashes will be contained in a list, and the items in
  the list will be indexes to the LED list we implemented in the previous
  project. In other words, we'll create a list of values between 0 and 3, each
  representing an LED. Remember, lists start counting at 0, so the first LED is
  actually represented as the 0th element of the list. The fourth LED is
  represented as the 3rd element of the list.</p>

  <p>We'll call our list of LEDs <code>play_order</code> and we'll have it run
  through a quick sequence of 8 LED flashes hitting each LED twice.</p>

  <p>Here's what our LED sequence list should look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

play_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Finally, we want to actually play that sequence of flashes on our LED.
  First, we'll ensure that all the LEDs are turned off when we start, since we
  can't be sure of the previous state of the GPIOs. Then, we'll use a for loop
  to run through our sequence list, turning the LEDs on one at a time for .4
  seconds and then waiting .2 seconds between each flash. Here's what the play
  sequence should look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
# Play sequence

for light in lights: 
        light.off()

for i in play_order: 
        lights[i].on() 
        time.sleep(0.4) 
        lights[i].off()
        time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Notice that we leave the LEDs on for .4 seconds and then have a .2 second
  delay between flashes.</p>

  <p>Here is our full code at this point -- when you run it, you will see the
  four LEDs flash in the hard-coded pattern that we've added to the code:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]

# Play sequence
for light in lights: 
        light.off()

for i in play_order: 
        lights[i].on() 
        time.sleep(0.4) 
        lights[i].off()
        time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>
