<p>In our last project, we finished wiring up the four LEDs and
tested
to verify they work. &nbsp;Assuming your buttons and LEDs are all
working correctly, we're done with the circuit implementation for our
Simon-like game. &nbsp;Pretty amazing that you now know enough to
build
the hardware for an electronic toy you can buy at the store!
&nbsp;And
in just a few projects, you'll be able to write all the code as well.</p>
<p>So,
let's jump in to that code writing.
</p>
<p>To start programming our game, the first thing we want to do
is learn how to flash a sequence of LEDs, as this will be the basis for
the entire game.
&nbsp;For this project, we'll start slow and just use a pre-defined
list to create a planned sequence of LED
flashes.
&nbsp;For the next project, we'll expand on that by making the
flashing
sequence random.</p>
<h2>Programming Implementation</h2>
<p>The first thing we're going to need to do is to import the
modules and functions we'll be using&nbsp;and initialize our list
of LEDs. &nbsp;Here's what our initialization code should look like:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

from rstem.gpio import Output&lt;br&gt;
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;"></span></p>
<p>The sequence of LED flashes will be contained in a list, and
the items in the list will be indexes to the LED list we implemented in
the previous project. &nbsp;In other words, we'll create a list of
values between 0 and 3, each representing an LED. &nbsp;Remember,
lists start counting at 0, so the first LED is actually represented as
the 0th element of the list. &nbsp;The fourth LED is represented as
the 3rd element of the list.</p>
<p>We'll
call our list of LEDs <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">play_order</span>
and we'll have it run through a quick
sequence of 8 LED flashes hitting each LED twice.</p>
<p>Here's what our LED sequence list should look like:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea># Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

play_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Finally, we want to actually play that sequence of flashes on
our LED. &nbsp;First, we'll ensure that all the LEDs are turned off
when we start, since we can't be sure of the previous state of the
GPIOs. &nbsp;Then, we'll use a for loop to run through our sequence
list, turning the LEDs on one at a time for .4 seconds and then waiting
.2 seconds between each flash. &nbsp;Here's what the play sequence
should look like:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea># Play sequence

for light in lights: 
	light.off()

for i in play_order: 
	lights[i].on() 
	time.sleep(0.4) 
	lights[i].off()
	time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Notice that we leave the LEDs on for .4 seconds and then have
a .2 second delay between flashes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is our full code at this point -- when you run it, you will see the four LEDs
flash in the hard-coded pattern that we've added to the code:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]

# Play sequence
for light in lights: 
	light.off()

for i in play_order: 
	lights[i].on() 
	time.sleep(0.4) 
	lights[i].off()
	time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea></div>
