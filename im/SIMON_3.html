<h1>SIMON 3</h1>
<p>In our last project, we finished wiring up the four LEDs and tested
to verify they work. &nbsp;Assuming your buttons and LEDs are all
working correctly, we're done with the circuit implementation for our
Simon-like game. &nbsp;Pretty amazing that you now know enough to build
the hardware for an electronic toy you can buy at the store! &nbsp;And
in just a few projects, you'll be able to write all the code as well.</p><p>So,
let's jump in to that code writing. &nbsp;In this project, we're going
to implement the buttons and LEDs using lists. &nbsp;They won't
function any differently from the last two projects -- the LEDs will
light up and the buttons will register as pushed when pushed -- but by
using lists to manage the components, we'll make all our future code
	<p class=toc><a href="SIMON_2.html">prev</a>|

much easier to write and understand.</p><br><h2>Programming Implementation</h2><h2>Executing Your Code</h2><p></p><br>
