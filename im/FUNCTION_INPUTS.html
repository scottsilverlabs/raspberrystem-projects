<h1>FUNCTION INPUTS</h1>
<p>Now that we have a basic idea of what a function is and how it
works, let's talk about one of the more powerful aspects of using
functions. &nbsp;Oftentimes,
functions will contain code that we want to use over and over again,
but we’re going to want the code to do slightly different things
based on other things going on in our software. </p>
<p>For example, when
your cell phone rings, the software inside your phone is doing a lot
of complicated stuff to generate the ring. Your phone has to “wake
up,” turn on the back light, print information on the display,
check to see if you’re pushing any buttons, play ringtone, etc. In
fact, the code that makes your cell phone ring may contain a hundred
or more lines of code. </p>
<p>When different
friends call, you’re going to see different information on your
screen. For your friend John, you might see John’s name, phone
number and picture. For your friend Allison, you might see Allison’s
name, phone number and picture. Does this mean that the software has
to have a hundred lines of code for John and a different hundred
lines of code for Allison (as well as a different hundred lines of
code every other person in your contact list)? </p>
<p>Luckily, no…</p>
<p>With functions, we
have the ability to do generic tasks (like generate a ring), while
also changing based on specific information (like putting different
information on the screen for different callers). This is done by
sending “inputs” (also called “parameters”) to the function. Parameters
are just pieces of information that the function uses to
customize the task it is performing.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to
our previous project where we printed two pieces of information on
the screen – my name (Jason) and the year I was born (1971). What
if we wanted to print a name and birth year for other people as well
– people with a different name and birth year than mine? To do
this, we modify our function to receive parameters and to use those
parameters to customize what the function does.</p>
<p>In this example, our
function is going to take two parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A birth year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We tell the function
what parameters to expect by listing them between the parentheses in
the first line of the function (the line that names the function). Each
parameter has its own name, which should be descriptive of what
the parameter is. </p>
<p>For example, if we
wanted to modify our function from the previous project to take a
name and a birth year parameters, it might look like this:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
def print_info(name, birth_year):
</textarea></div>
<p>“name” and “year” are now variables that we set when we call
the function,
and those variables can be used within that function: </p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
def print_info(name, birth_year):
	print('My name is: ', name)
	print('I was born in: ', birth_year)
</textarea></div>
<p>Now, when we call
the print_info function, we will always supply two parameters to the
function – a name and a year. </p>
<p>For example, let’s
say we have a friend named Bob and he was born in 1992. We can send
his information to the function like this:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="5">
<div></div>
<textarea>
print_info('Bob', 1992)
</textarea></div>
<p>Notice that we put
quotation marks around “Bob” to make it a string (as you would
expect), but we left the quotation marks off of 1992, making it a
number instead of a string. While we could have put quotation marks
around 1992 to make it a string, I’ve decided to make it a number
for reasons that will become clear later on.</p>
<p>As another example,
let’s say we have a friend named Susie who was born in 1985, and we
want to print her information as well:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="6">
<div></div>
<textarea>
print_info('Susie', 1985)
</textarea></div>
<p>Now, let’s put it
all together, and see what our code would look like if we had this
new function and we called this function twice – once to print
Bob’s information and once to print Susie’s information:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
def print_info (name, birth_year):
	print('My name is: ', name)
	print('I was born in: ', birth_year)

print_info('Bob', 1992)
print_info('Susie', 1985)
</textarea></div>
<p>You may have noticed
that this example is very similar to our cell phone example above. The
software in a cell phone likely handles a ring by calling a
function – the parameters to this function would be all the
information that the function needs to correctly display the caller’s
information on the screen and make the phone ring. So, the
parameters that likely get sent to the function would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name of caller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phone number of caller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picture to be displayed for that caller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ring tone to be used for that caller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We realize that functions aren't the most exciting topic in
the world, but there is another function topic that's important to
understand before getting too far into the projects. &nbsp;If
you're not familiar with them, you should check out <a href="FUNCTION_OUTPUTS.html">FUNCTION OUTPUTS</a>
