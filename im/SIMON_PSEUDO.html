    <div id=description>In this project, we kick off the development of our Simon-like
    pattern matching game by writing the pseudo-code for our game.</div>

</header>

<p>Over the next eight projects, we're going to use buttons, LEDs
and a good bit of code to build and program a pattern-matching game
much like the popular toy Simon.  </p>
<p>If you're not
familiar with Simon, let me describe how our pattern-matching game will
work.  The game will start by flashing one of four LEDs at
random (and
will
play a tone speciific to that LED).  You (the player) will
then have a short
amount of time to press the button associated with the LED that
flashed.
 If
you do that successfully, the game will repeat the first LED flash and
then add a second LED flash at random.  Again, you'll need to
remember the pattern and press the correct buttons to replicate the
pattern.  Each time you successfully enter the correct
sequence,
the game will replay the previous pattern and add a random new
LED
flash at the end.  This will continue until you incorrectly
repeat the sequence --
of if
you take too long between button presses -- at which point the game
ends and the entire sequence is repeated back to you one last time.</p>
<p>
Since
this is a bit longer and more complex project than we've done so far,
it's important to spend some time planning what the code will do and in
what order.  
To do this, we'll create an outline for Simon is through a common
programming technique called pseudo-code.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="info">
<div>Pseudo-Code</div>
<div>
<p>
 Writing pseudo-code before you write software is similar to
writing an outline before you write a paper or an article.
 Basically, you create an outline for your code using a
combination of regular English mixed with some bits of programming
code.  This allows you (or others) to read the order of the
code and determine if what you're getting ready to write is logical and
will accomplish what you'd expect.</p>
<p>Let's use the 
    <a href="MANY_BUTTONS.html">MANY BUTTONS</a> project to show an example of
    how we'd write pseudo-code.  In that project, we had a bunch of buttons, and we wanted to print
    when the buttons were pressed.</p>
<p>Here is what our pseudo-code might look like:</p>
<pre>
Create a list of Buttons
Repeat:
    For each button in the list of buttons:
        If the button is pressed:
            Print which button was pressed
    Pause
</pre>
<p>You notice that each line is easily
readable as English -- with some indenting to help the readbility
-- and overall, you now have a outline that you can
use as a template to create your code.  </p>
<p>Now, in reality, you might not need to use pseudo-code for such a simple program.
But, for more complex software, writing
the pseudo-code before you start writing the actual code can make the
entire process much easier.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Let's talk about what the pseudo-code for our Simon game will
look like.  An effective way to outline a programming project is to start with big
ideas and then break those ideas down into smaller and smaller pieces, until
the pieces are small enough that we're comfortable starting to write our
code.</p>
<p>For example, this is what the very high level outline for our
Simon game might look like:</p>
<pre>
Import Modules and Initialize Game
Add another random LED to sequence
Play LED sequence 
Allow player to repeat sequence one button at a time 
Get the user's button press
If user enters incorrect button, end game
If user enters correct button, flash LED and play tone
If the user enters the entire sequence, go back to top and add another LED to the sequence 
If the user enters the wrong sequence, play an error sequence
</pre>
<p>That's
basically all our Simon game needs to do.  But, now it's time
to start thinking about how this outline would actually look when
written with code. You'll notice that the last two lines indicate that
-- for as long as the user does something correctly -- we go back to
the top of the code.  Does this sound like a concept we've
already discussed?  A <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span>
loop, perhaps?</p>
<p>Also, you'll notice that in the middle of the code, we're
checking for the sequence of button presses from the user --
one-by-one.  This sequence of getting input and checking it
would likely be a loop as well -- in this case, probably a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">for</span>
loop.</p>
<p>Let's
rewrite our pseudo-code above, but this time, let's add in a couple
loops to make it more clear how the code will work:</p>

<pre>
Import Modules and Initialize Game
while (user enters the sequence correctly):
    Add another random LED to sequence
    Play LED sequence 
    for (each of the buttons in the sequence): 
        Get the user's button press
        If user enters incorrect button:
            end game
        Otherwise (user entered correct button), so flash LED and play tone
If the user enters the wrong sequence, play an error sequence
</pre>
<p>The pseudo-code above is still very simple to follow, but by
adding in the two loops, we start to see the format for our program.</p>
<p>We
could drill down into each piece of the pseudo-code further -- and in
some future projects we'll be much more detailed -- but for our
Simon-like game, we think this is enough detail to get started.
 As we build up the code over the next many projects, we'll
use
the outline above to organize and ensure that we're doing everything
that needs to be done to get the game working properly.</p>
