<h1>INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS</h1>
<p>In this project
we’re going to learn about functions and modules.  A function is one of the
most basic concepts in programming, and also one of the most
important.  It often takes a lot of code to get a computer to do even
a simple task.  And if you want the computer to do a simple task over
and over again, that could mean having to write lots of code over and
over again.  
</p>
<p>That doesn’t sound
very efficient, does it?  
</p>
<p>It’s not, which is
why instead of writing the same code many times, we have the ability to just write the
code once in a special format, and then we can use that code over and
over again, as many times as we want.  That special format that
allows us to re-use the code over and over again is called a
function.</p>
<p>Here’s an example…</p>
<p>Let’s say that we
wanted to write some code that would print my name and the year I was
born.  We could do this exactly like we did with the “Hello,
World!” code we wrote in Project #1, and our code might look like
the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">print
(‘My name is:  Jason’)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">print
(‘I was born in:  1971’)</p>
<p>Now let’s say we
expected to print those same lines many times within our code.  While
we could type those lines over and over again in the code, that would
…</p>
<p>The simpler way
would be to create a function that prints those two lines, and then
“call” the function every time we want those lines printed. 
Let’s turn the above two lines into a function that we can call
from other places in our code.</p>
<p>The first step in
creating a function is giving it a name.  In this case, let’s say
we wanted to call this function, “print_info”.  This is done by
using the “def” keyword on the first line of the function,
followed by the function name, a set of parentheses and a colon:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">def
print_info ( ):</p>
<p>After the first line
that names the function comes the code that we want our function to
run every time it is called.  In this case, it’s the two print
lines we discussed earlier.  So, this is what our function would look
like:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">def
print_info ( ):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">
print (‘My name is:  Jason’)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">
print (‘I was born in:  1971’)</p>
<p>Notice that all the
code lines of the function are indented.  This is required, and is
how the code knows which lines are associated with which function.</p>
<p>To now use that
function, we can call it elsewhere in our code like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">print_info
( )</p>
<p>All we have to do to
call the function is to provide the function name followed by a set
of parentheses.</p>
<p>Let’s put it all
together and write a program that defines this function and then
calls this function to actually have it print out those two lines:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">def
print_info ( ):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">
print (‘My name is:  Jason’)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">
print (‘I was born in:  1971’)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">print_info
( )</p>
<p>One big value in
functions is that it allows us to reuse the same code over and over. 
So, let’s see what happens when we call that function several times
in a row:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">def
print_info ( ):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">
print (‘My name is:  Jason’)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">
print (‘I was born in:  1971’)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">print_info
( )</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">print_info
( )</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">print_info
( )</p>
<p>If you run this
program, you’ll see that each of the three times the function is
called, it prints the two lines.  Imagine if we were going to need
those two lines printed a hundred times throughout our program –
you can see how using a function is a lot simpler and also makes our
code much less complicated.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b> We
mentioned earlier that when you run a program, the computer will
execute each line of code, starting at the top and moving down
through the code, line-by-line.  But, when the computer sees a
function, it doesn’t execute that code until the function is
called.  So, for our code above, the first three lines (the function
definition and the two lines of code in the function) are ignored and
the computer will start by executing the first line below the
function.  To make things simpler, functions are often stored in
separate files, so that the code is easier to read and follow.</p>
