  <h1>Going Loopy</h1>
  <p>All of our first circuits contained just one loop - from our power source
  through and LED and resistor, and then to the ground of our power source.  In
  the real-world, circuits get more complicated as more components are added.
  Inside processors, there are millions upon millions of interconnected wires
  and components, making millions and millions of teensy loops.

<p>Lets start with an example circuit we've seen before, a simple circuit that
is a loop of two components: a battery and a resistor.
    <p><mark>Battery/resistor schematic
<p>When you add a new component to the loop, assuming it has just two leads
(legs) like a resistor does, there are exactly two ways you can do it.  
The first way is that you can add the component
in <strong>series</strong> with the other component:
    <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor series schematic
<p>In addition, you could have even more components in <strong>series</strong>:
    <p><mark>Battery/3-resistor series schematic
<p>The second way is that you can add the component
in <strong>parallel</strong> with the other component:
    <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor parallel schematic
<p>In addition, you could have even more components in <strong>parallel</strong>:
    <p><mark>Battery/3-resistor parallel schematic <p>Of course, you aren't
    limited to just series or just parallel - the two can be combined to create
    more complex circuits:
    <p><mark>Battery/multiple-resistor parallel and series schematic
<p>And, finally, there are some types of components (like a computer chip) that
have more the two leads, which means that series and parallel does not apply.

  <h1>Series & Parallel Resistance</h1>
  <p>So what happens when you add a component is series or parallel?  The water analogy works
  really well here to give us a picture of what's going on.

  <p>When resistances are in series, the total resistance adds up.  That is,
  each resistance contributes more to resist the current around the circuit.  For example, given
  one of our examples from above:
    <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor series schematic, marked with R1 and R2
    <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER series schematic
<p>So, in this case, the total resistance is the sum: R1 + R2
<p>And, this means that: <strong>two equal resistances in <i>series</i> gives
exactly
<i>twice</i> the resistance.</strong>

  <p>When resistances are in parallel, the total <i>conductance</i> adds up.
  <i>Conductance</i> is the reciprocal of the resistance.  In other words,
  resistance is a measure of how <i>difficult</i> it is for current to flow
  through a component, while conductance is the opposite - a measure of how
  <i>easy</i> it is for current to flow through a component.  
  This is more evident in a picture:
    <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor parallel schematic, marked with R1 and R2
    <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER parallel schematic
<p>As you increase the number of resistors you allow <i>more</i> current to
flow.  So, in this case, the total
<i>conductance</i> is the sum of the individual <i>conductances</i>, or:
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>R1</sub> + 
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>R2</sub>

<p>The math for this can be a bit more confusing, but is very clear from the
water analogy picture.  Two equal resistors in parallel allow twice the amount
of current to flow, or in other words, they resist the current flow less (half
as much).
<p>So, this means that: 
 <strong>two equal resistances in <i>parallel</i> gives
exactly <i>half</i> the resistance.</strong>
