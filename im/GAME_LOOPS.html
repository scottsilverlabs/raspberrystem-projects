    <div id=description>In this project, we introduce the concept of Game Loops, and we use a 
	    game loop to create a very basic game for the LED Matrix display.</div>

<p>Now that
we have the LED Matrix as
a display and can take input with buttons, there's no reason we can't
start creating some simple games.  But, before we do that,
there
are some basics of computer game programming that are helpful to
understand; in fact, once you get through this project, we'd be willing
to bet that you have a new appreciation for how video games
work.  </p>
<p>Most
computer games (and especially those that most kids would consider to
be video
games) share a common method of programming called the “game loop.”
 A game
loop is a simple concept, but is the heart of most video games.  </code>The game loop essentially
works by doing the
same things over and over the entire time the game is running.</p>


<p>We're
going to explain game loops below using pseudo-code, which we discussed
in more detail in our Simon 0 project.</p>
<p>
The pseudo-code
for a typical game loop will look something like this:</p>
<pre>
Initialize the game environment

while (game not finished):
	Check for user input
	Update the game world
	Draw graphics on the screen
	Wait for some period of time

Finish & Cleanup
</pre>
<p>We'll examine this loop line-by-line below.  And at the same time, let's build our very own (very
simple) game loop that will move a dot around the LED Matrix...</p>

<h2>Initialize the game environment</h2>
<p>The
very first step in any game is to initialize anything that will be used
in the game loop.  If you're not familiar with the term
"initialize," it basically means setting up all the aspects of the game
so that when the user starts playing, the game code is ready to be executed. For example,
this might include importing
libraries and functions we'll need later in the code, creating a
framebuffer (or perhaps
many framebuffers) that will hold the graphics during the game,
defining the start location and speed of various game characters, etc.
 </p>
<p>In our case, we're going to want to do three things to get
ready for our game loop:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Import the <code>Framebuffer()</code> function and the time library</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a framebuffer that we'll use to draw and display
the
dot </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initialize the location of a dot when the loop starts
(in this case, let's put the dot in the corner of the LED Matrix)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's what the code will look like:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

fb = FrameBuffer()

x, y = (0, 0)
fb.erase()
fb.point(x, y)
</textarea></div>
<h2>while (game not finished):</h2>
<p>We
call it a game loop because it's an actual loop in the code that
continues until the game is finished or until the user says chooses to exit.
 For this project, we're going to take the easy way out and
just
let the program run forever (until we stop the program).  We
can
do this using a <code>while
True:</code> loop.  </p>
<p>So, this will be the very first
line
of our
game loop:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
while True:
</textarea></div>
<h2>Check for user input</h2>
<p>In
a typical game loop, this is where we would check for user input --
check for button presses, check for joystick movement, check for
controller movement, etc.  And we'll do that in some
subsequent
projects.  But, for this particular project, we're keeping
things
simple and we're not taking any input from the user.  So,
there's no code to add for this part of the loop.</p>
<h2>Update the game world</h2>
<p>Updating
the game world means taking the new information we have -- either from
the user input we've received or just because we are further along in
time -- and to use this new information to update any parts of our game
that now need to change.  For example, in a character-based
game,
if a user has indicated that they want their character to move to the
right of the screen, the game world update might involve changing the
location of the character, shifting the background, changing the
location of other characters in the game, etc.  This part of
the
game loop will figure out what
the next set of graphics to display looks like in preparation to draw
the new graphics.</p>
<p>In our example, we're just going to
automatically move the dot to the right one space, regardless of what
the user does.  To do that, we need to increment the
x-coordinate
by 1.  We then erase the current framebuffer data and update
the
framebuffer with the new location.</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
x += 1
</textarea></div>
<h2>Draw graphics on the screen</h2>
<p>Once
we have updated all the aspects of the game world and have the
information about what will get displayed next, it's time to actually
display the the new graphics.  This typically
involves
erasing and drawing the new graphics to the framebuffer and then
displaying that framebuffer.  We can do that just like we did
in
the
last project:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
fb.erase()
fb.point(x, y)
fb.show()
</textarea></div>
<h2>Wait for some period of time</h2>
<p>
The very last thing we often do in a game loop is to wait for some period
of time.  This (roughly) sets the rate at which the display gets updated.  By
setting the frame rate, we can know exactly how much to move graphics around the
display from one frame to the next.  
</p>
<p>
Because your graphics will be updating each time through the loop, you'll want
to choose a wait time that makes sense for your graphics updates.  If not,
you'll probably want to play around with various pause times and see which work
the best -- too slow, and you might find that your program is not responsive;
too fast, and you might find that the processor wastes power and causes poor
performance of other programs running on the computer at the same time.
</p>
<p>In this case, our graphics rely on the loop speed, and we'd
probably be happy moving
the location of the dot every half-second.  Which means we'll
want to put
in a half-second delay at the end of the loop.</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
time.sleep(.5)
</textarea></div>
<h2>Finish &amp; Cleanup</h2>
<p>At
some point, the game will probably end and we'll drop out of the loop.
 This is most common when the player wins or loses a game, or
when
a player purposefully exits a game for some reason.  When that
happens, you may want to indicate to the user the final outcome of the
game, play a separate set of graphics (for example, something special
if the player beats the game) or you may want to go back to another
menu screen.  </p>
<p>In this project, we never drop out of
the loop (remember, we used a while True: loop), so there doesn't need
to be any code at this point in the program.</p>
<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>We
now have all of the code necessary for a game loop that will place a
dot at one corner of the LED Matrix display and then move that dot to
the right every half-second.  Here's what the entire snippet
of
code should look like:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Initialize the game environment
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

fb = FrameBuffer()
x, y = (0, 0)
fb.erase()

while True: 
	# Get user input 

	# Update the game world 
	x += 1 

	# Draw graphics on the screen 
	fb.erase() 
	fb.point(x, y) 
	fb.show() 

	# Wait for some period of time 
	time.sleep(.5)

# Finish &amp; Cleanup
</textarea></div>

<p>When you run this code, you should see
the dot start at one corner of the LED Matrix and move in one direction
until it is off the screen.  Because we're not checking to see
if
the dot is still on the screen or not, the code will just continue to
run even after you can no longer see the dot.  So, once the
dot
has disappeared, you can stop the program.</p>
