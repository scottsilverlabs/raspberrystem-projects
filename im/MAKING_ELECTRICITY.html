  <h1>How electricity is made</h1>

<p>Batteries are an critical in powering our everyday devices, from mobile phones
and laptops, to watches and hearing aids.  Batteries use a chemical reaction to
convert chemical energy into electrical energy.

<p>However, most of the electricity we use everyday comes from the power
company.  This electrical energy is readily available through outlets around
our homes, and heats our home, runs our computers, cooks our food, lights our
rooms, and many more things...  Where does the energy come from to do this, and
how does it get to our homes?

<p>There are a number of different ways that the power company provides
electricity, but the most common way is through an electric generator.  A
generator is a device that converts mechanical energy (movement) into
electrical energy.  So, to generate electricity, all you need to do is provide
the mechanical energy to turn the generator.  For example, if you actuually turn the generator by hand, then <i>you</i> can generate electricty.

      Funky magnets.  How do they work?
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>It turns out that magnetism and electricty and are two tightly
    intertwined related concepts.  Magnets can generate electric current, and
    likewise, electric currents can generate the affects of a magnet.  When a
    magnet moves nears a closed loop of conducting wire, a current is generated
    in the loop.  And the reverse is true as well: an electric current near a
    magnetc will push the magnet.
    <p>Both of these concepts are used in two very similar items:
  <ul>
    <li><p>In an <i>generator</i> a loop of wire rotated around a magnet generates a current in that wire.
    
    </li>
    <li><p>In an electric <i>motor</i> a current in a loop of wire causes a magnet to turn.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Electric motors are used everywhere - they spin our washing machines, they
  run our air conditioning and refrigerators, pump our water, and even turn
  the wheels on electric vehicles.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>

<p>The primary way to mechanically turn a generate is to push steam through a
turbine (which is similar to a fan).  The steam pushes the blades of the
turbine, which turns the generator to generate electricy.  So how do you
generate steam?  You need to boil water, which you can do in many ways:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Burn something.  This is the primary way generating electrical
    energy in the U.S.  The main fuel we burn is coal, followed by natural gas.
    </li>
    <li><p>Nuclear reactors use a process of "splitting" atoms which releases
    vasts amount of energy.  This energy can be used to boil water.
    </li>
    <li><p>Solar energy: Mirros and lenses can reflect the sun's light to a
    small spot that geneartes huge amount of heat.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>So that is how electricity is generated - but how does it get to the
electronics in your home.  The power company relies on a vast network of
interconnected wires (often called "the grid") that deliver electrical energy
to you and your neighbors homes.

lines to home </mark>

<p>Its important to note in the above picture that the generator, wires, and
lightbulb form one continuous loop.  It is this circuit, which starts many
miles away at a power plant, around which the current flows.  Think about this
as you work on the following project, where we will stop using the battery and
instead use power coming from the Raspberry Pi.  The Raspberry Pi gets
<i>it's</i> power from the wall outlet, which is connected to a generator at a
power plant far away in one long continuous loop.
