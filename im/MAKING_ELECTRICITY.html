  <h1>How electricity is made</h1>

<p>Batteries play a critical part in powering our everyday devices, from mobile
phones
and laptops, to watches and hearing aids.  Batteries use a chemical reaction to
convert chemical energy into electrical energy.

<p>However, most of the electrical energy  we use everyday comes from the power
company.  This electrical energy is readily available through outlets around
our homes, and heats our home, runs our computers, cooks our food, lights our
rooms, recharges our batteries, and so much more...  Where does the energy to
do this come from, and how does it get to our homes?

<p>There are a number of different ways that the power company provides
electric power, but the most common way is through an electric generator.  A
generator is a device that converts mechanical energy (movement) into
electrical energy.  So, to generate electrical energy, all you need to do is
provide the mechanical energy to turn the generator.  For example, if you
actually turn a generator by hand, then <i>you</i> can generate electrical
energy.

<p>One thing to remember, though - electrical energy is never "made" out
of thin air.  The energy already exists - we simply convert other forms of
energy into electrical energy.

      Funky magnets.  How do they work?
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>It turns out that magnetism and electricity and are two tightly
    intertwined related concepts.  Moving magnets can generate electric current
    in conductors, and likewise, electric currents can generate the same
    pulling forces that a magnet provides.  When a magnet moves nears a closed
    loop of conducting wire, a current is generated
    in the loop.  And the reverse is true as well: an electric current near a
    magnet will push the magnet.
    <p>Both of these concepts are used in two very similar items:
  <ul>
    <li><p>In an electric <i>generator</i> a loop of wire rotated around a magnet generates a current in that wire.
    
    </li>
    <li><p>In an electric <i>motor</i> a current in a loop of wire causes a magnet to turn.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Electric motors are used everywhere - they spin washing machines, they
  run air conditioners and refrigerators, pump water, and even turn
  the wheels on electric vehicles.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>

<p>The primary way to mechanically turn a generator is to push steam through a
turbine (which is basically a large fan with many fan blades).  The steam
pushes the blades of the turbine, which turns the shaft of the generator to
generate electrical energy.  So how do you generate steam?  You need to boil
water, which you can do in many ways:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Burn something.  This is the primary way generating electrical
    energy in the U.S.  The main fuel we burn is coal, followed by natural gas.
    </li>
    <li><p>Nuclear reactors use a process of "splitting" atoms which releases
    vasts amount of energy.  This energy can be used to boil water.
    </li>
    <li><p>Solar energy: Mirrors and lenses can reflect the sun's light to a
    small spot that geneartes huge amount of heat.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>So that is how electrical energy is generated - but how does it go from
being generated to powering the electronics in your home?  The power company
relies on a vast network of
interconnected wires (often called "the grid") that deliver electrical energy
to you and your neighbor's homes.

lines to home </mark>

<p>Its important to note in the above picture that the generator, wires, and
lightbulb form one continuous loop.  It is this circuit, which starts many
miles away at a power plant, around which the current flows.  Think about this
as you work on the following project, where we will stop using the battery and
instead use power coming from the Raspberry Pi.  The Raspberry Pi gets
<i>it's</i> power from the wall outlet, which is connected to a generator at a
power plant far away in one long continuous loop.

<p>Boiling water to turn a turbine isn't the only way to turn a generator and
generate electrical energy.  In fact, sometimes you can turn generator
directly.  For example:
  <ul>
    <li><p>A hydroelectric power plant user the power of a water fall to turn
    the shaft of a generator.
    </li>
    <li><p>A wind turbine uses the force of the wind to directly turn the shaft
    of a generator.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>And, there are other ways to generate electrical energy as well, including solar
cells, which directly convert the sun's energy to electric current, without any
moving parts at all!
