<h1>DICTIONARIES</h1>

<p>In a previous concept, we discussed "Lists," how they work and what they
are good for.  If you recall, Lists are great for storing an ordered 
sequence of items.  For example, a list of names or a list of values.  
In a List, the sequence of the data is important, and each piece of data
is an independent entity.

<p>Sometimes though, you want to be able to associate certain pieces of 
data with other pieces of data.  For example, you may have a list of
people, and you want to associate each person's age with each name.

<p>Here's an example:

<p></p>

<div align="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px;"><p><strong>NAME</strong></p></td>
<td style="width: 100px;"><p><strong>AGE</strong></p></td>
</tr><tr>
<td><p>Bob</p></td>
<td><p>22</p></td>
</tr><tr>
<td><p>John</p></td>
<td><p>14</p></td>
</tr><tr>
<td><p>Alice</p></td>
<td><p>36</p></td>
</tr><tr>
<td><p>Carol</p></td>
<td><p>29</p></td>
</tr><tr>
<td><p>Alex</p></td>
<td><p>64</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Using a list to store this these associated pieces of data is very
difficult and cumbersome.  But, Python provides another mechanism
that is perfect for storing data in this way -- it's called a 
<i>Dictionary</i>.  Just like a regular Dictionary that is use to map words to their 
defintions, a Python Dictionary maps "keys" (the first column)
to their "values" (the second column).</p>  

<p>Here's an example of how we could use Dictionaries in our code...

<p>Imagine we wanted to make use of the months of the year, along
with their abbreviations and the number of days they contain.  We 
could create two Dictionaries -- one that maps the months of the year
to their abbreviations and another that maps the abbreviations to
the number of days in that particular month.

<p>Here is what the code to define these Dictionaries might look 
like (to keep things short, we won't use all the months):

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Create a Dictionary of months to abbreviations
month_abbr = {
    'January': 'Jan',
    'February': 'Feb',
    'March': 'Mar',
    'April': 'Apr',
    'May': 'May'

# Create a Dictionary of months to how many days they have
month_days = {
    'Jan': '31',
    'Feb': '28',
    'Mar': '31',
    'Apr': '30',
    'May': '31'
}
</textarea></div>

<p>Now that we have our Dictionaries created, we can perform
a number of operations on them.  Here are just a few examples
of what we can do with our Dictionaries:

<p>We can add more entries to our Dictionaries:

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Add some new months
month_abbr['June'] = 'Jun'
month_abbr['July'] = 'Jul'

month_days['June'] = '30'
month_days['July'] = '31'
</textarea></div>

<p>We can access our entries and print out information:

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Print out information about the months
print "Abbreviation for January is: ", month_abbr['January']
print "Abbreviation for February is: ", month_days['February']

print "# of Days in March: ", month_days['Mar']
print "# of Days in April: ", month_days['Apr']
</textarea></div>

<p>We can use information from one Dictionary to query another Dictionary:

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Print number of days the month
print "# of Day in January: ", month_days[month_abbr['January']]
print "# of Day in Febuary: ", month_days[month_abbr['February']]
</textarea></div>

<p>We can use a loop to print out all available Dictionary entries:

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Print months along with abbreviations and number of days
for month, abbreviation in months_abbr.items():
    print "The month %s is abbreviated %s and has %s days" % (
        month, abbreviation, month_days[abbreviation])
</textarea></div>
