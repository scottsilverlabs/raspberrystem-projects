<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In our last project, we created a basic Minecraft game controller and wrote the 
code to allow us to map the buttons and accelerometer to specific functionality
related to Steve, our Minecraft character.  

<p>In this project, we will implement
the same functionality as we did previously, but we will revise the code to use
a Dictionary to map the button inputs to functionality, making the program much more 
simple and straightforward.  This will be the foundation of our future Minecraft
programs.

<h2>Writing Our Code</h2>

<p>Our goal with this project is to greatly simplify the button controls
we implemented in our Controller 1 project.  This will make future controller
projects easier to write and will also make the code easier to read
and debug

<p>As a reminder, here is the code from the previous project that we're going to 
focus on changing:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1"> <div></div> <textarea>
left = Button(18)
right = Button(14)
up = Button(15)
down = Button(23)

accel = Accel()

control.show()

while True:
    if left.is_pressed():
        control.left()
    else:
        control.left(release=True)
    if right.is_pressed():
        control.right()
    else:
        control.right(release=True)
    if up.is_pressed():
        control.forward()
    else:
        control.forward(release=True)
    if down.is_pressed():
        control.backward()
    else:
        control.backward(release=True)
</textarea></div>

<p>Specifically, in this project, we're going to make two major
changes to the code above:

<ol>
<li><p>We will use a Dictionary to define the button controls and 
use a <code>for</code> loop to reduce the large number of <code>if/else</code> 
loops</p>
<li><p>We will greatly simplify the remaining <code>if/else</code> statement
in our code</p>
</ol>

<h3>Step #1:  Implement a Dictionary and a <code>for</code> loop</h3>

<p>The first thing we're going to do to simplify our code is to 
use a Python Dictionary to enumerate (create a list of) our button
controls.  

<p>If you recall, a Dictionary maps a set of keys to their
values.  In this case, the set of keys will be the buttons and 
their respective GPIOs, and the values will be the specific 
<code>control</code> commands for each:

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"> <div></div> <textarea>
keymap = {
    Button(23) : control.left,
    Button(14) : control.right,
    Button(18) : control.forward,
    Button(15) : control.backward,
    Button(7)  : control.smash,
    Button(24) : control.jump,
    }
</textarea></div>

<p>Now that we have our button control definitions in a Dictionary,
we can replace the large number of <code>if/else</code> statements
(one set for each button) with a <code>for</code> loop and single
set of <code>if/else</code> statements:

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"> <div></div> <textarea>
    for button, action in keymap.items():
        if button.is_pressed():
            action
        else:
            action(release=True)
</textarea></div>

<h3>Step #2:  Simplify the <code>if/else</code> statement</h3>

<p>In our code above, we use a four-line if-else statement
to check each controller button (to see if it was being pressed)
each time through the game loop:

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"> <div></div> <textarea>
        if button.is_pressed():
            action(release=False)
        else:
            action(release=True)
</textarea></div>

<p>While this works just fine, using four lines of code is a lot 
more cumbersome than necessary.

<p><b>NOTE:</b>You may notice that in the Controller 1 project and in 
Step #1 above, we did not
include <code>release=False</code> in the first <code>action</code> statement.
This is because that is the default assumption of the function,
and therefore it's not needed.  We include it above, as it will
make the next part of this discussion more understandable.

<p>As you can see, the first line of the code above tests whether the
button is being pressed.  If so, the second line of code takes
specific action; if not, the third and fourth lines of code stop 
the specific action.

<p>Those four lines of code can actually be condensed into the following
single line of code, which does the exact same thing:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1"> <div></div> <textarea>
        action(release=(not button.is_pressed()))
</textarea></div>

<div class="info">
<div>WHY DOES IT WORK?</div>

<p>If it's not clear why the single line of code above is equivalent
to the original four lines of code, let us take a minute to try
to explain it.

<p>You'll notice that the original four lines of code essentially
accomplish the following two things:

<ul>
<li><p>If <code>button.is_pressed()=True</code>, then <code>action(release=False)</code></li>
<li><p>If <code>button.is_pressed()=False</code>, then <code>action(release=True)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, the result of <code>button.is_pressed()</code> is changed to 
the opposite and inserted into the <code>action(release=...)</code> statement.

<p>The <code>not</code> keyword is referred to as a "boolean operator," and
it is used to flip False to True (0 to 1) and True to False (1 to 0).  The
statement:

<p><code>action(release=(not button.is_pressed()))</code>

<p>simply takes the result of <code>button.is_pressed()</code>, flips it
and inserts the result into the <code>release=...</code> statement.

</div>

<p>We can now replace the <code>if/else</code> statement in our <code>for</code>
with the single statement:

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"> <div></div> <textarea>
    for button, action in keymap.items():
        action(release=(not button.is_pressed()))
</textarea></div>

<h3>Full Code</h3>

<p>
Here is what the full code for this project should look like.  The
functionality is equivalent to the functionality in the Controller 1
project, but the code is much more compact and readable:
</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1"> <div></div> <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control
import time

control.show()

keymap = {
    Button(23) : control.left,
    Button(14) : control.right,
    Button(18) : control.forward,
    Button(15) : control.backward,
    Button(7)  : control.smash,
    Button(24) : control.jump,
    }

accel = Accel()

while True:
    for button, action in keymap.items():
        action(release=(not button.is_pressed()))

    x, y, z = accel.forces()
    control.look(up=50*y, left=50*x)
    
    time.sleep(0.01)

</textarea></div>
