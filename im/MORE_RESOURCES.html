<h1>MORE RESOURCES</h1>

In this document, we'll discuss some additional topics related to the 
RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit and the Raspberry Pi that will help you get the
most out of your kit.

Specifically, the sections below will discuss:

<ul>
	<li><p>Connecting to a Network</li>
	<li><p>Additional Raspberry Pi Features</li>
	<li><p>More Resources</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connecting to a Network</h2>

<p>There are likely going to be times when you're going to want to connect your
RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit to the Internet.  For example, you may want to 
download a new version of the RaspberrySTEM software or you may be interested
in getting additional Raspberry Pi projects that you want to implement on the 
RaspberrySTEM.</p>

<p>There are two ways to connect your RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit to the Internet:</p>

<h4>Wired Connectivity</h4>

<p>Of the two connectivity options, Wired Connectivity is typically going to
be the easiest, assuming you have access to a router that is connected to the
Internet.  Internet routers are standard if you have a home or business
Internet connection through your phone company or cable company, and will 
likely be located at the point where the cable or phone lines come into your
house.</p>

<p>Getting Internet connectivity on your RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit is 
typically as simple as plugging one side of an Ethernet cable (not included
with the kit) into the Ethernet port on the back of the Raspberry Pi (the
connector is located next to the USB connectors where your keyboard and 
mouse are plugged in) and then plugging the other side of the Ethernet cable 
into your Internet-connected router.</p>

<p>See the picture below for reference:</p>

<p>While this connectivity method should often work without any additional
configuration, if you find that you're having issues, you should verify that
your router is configured to use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
This is the way your router identifies and adds new devices to your network,
and is a default setting for most routers these days.</p>

<h4>Wireless Connectivity</h4>

<p>If it's not possible to connect your Raspberry Pi to the Internet using a 
hard-wired connection to your router (for example, if you don't have access
to your router), then the other option is to use a wireless adapter, which 
can be purchased at most computer electronics stores or online.</p>

<p>The wireless adapter will have a USB connector and will plug into one of
the free USB ports on the back of the Raspberry Pi.  Once that's completed,
follow these steps to get connectivity:</p>

</ol>


<h2>Additional Raspberry Pi Features</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi is a actual computer -- not much different than what's in 
a laptop computer or a cellphone -- and runs a full-featured Operating System.
When you're using the RaspberrySTEM Development Environment (RDE), you're simply
running an application on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>But, you can leave the RDE and use other features of the Raspberry Pi as 
well.  In this section, we'll talk about how to leave the RDE (and how to get 
back to it), as well as some of the things you can do outside the RDE.</p>

<h4>How to Get Out of the RDE</h4>

<p>When you exit from the RDE, you will be taken to a "desktop" environment
that looks similar to what you'd find on a typical desktop or laptop computer.
From here, you will see some clickable icons and pull-down menus.  This is 
the Raspian desktop, and it provides an interface to many of the other features
of the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>To get to the Raspian desktop from the RDE, simply press the following
three buttons all at the same time:</p>
<p>&lt;CRTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;D&gt;</p> 

<h4>How to Get Back to the RDE</h4>

<p>Once your on the Raspian desktop, you'll see an icon labeled, 
"RaspberrySTEM (RDE)".  If you double-click on that icon, it will bring you 
back to the RDE right where you left off.

<p>Here is what the icon should look like:</p>

<h2>More Resources to Check Out</h2>

<p>Once you have connectivity to the Internet from your Raspberry Pi (or, if
you'd prefer to just use an Internet-connected PC), there are lots of great
websites available that contain loads of Raspberry Pi resources, tutorials
and additional projects.</p>

<p>Here are some of our favorites:</p>
