<h2>Connecting to a Network</h2>

<p>There are likely going to be times when you're going to want to connect your
RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit to the Internet.  For example, you may want to 
download a new version of the RaspberrySTEM software or you may be interested
in getting additional Raspberry Pi projects that you want to implement on the 
RaspberrySTEM.</p>

<p>There are two ways to connect your RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit to the Internet:</p>

<h4>Wired Connectivity</h4>

<p>Of the two connectivity options, Wired Connectivity is typically going to
be the easiest, assuming you have access to a router that is connected to the
Internet.  Internet routers are standard if you have a home or business
Internet connection through your phone company or cable company, and will 
likely be located at the point where the cable or phone lines come into your
house.</p>

<p>Getting Internet connectivity on your RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit is 
typically as simple as plugging one side of an Ethernet cable (not included
with the kit) into the Ethernet port on the back of the Raspberry Pi (the
connector is located next to the USB connectors where your keyboard and 
mouse are plugged in) and then plugging the other side of the Ethernet cable 
into your Internet-connected router.</p>

<p>See the picture below for reference:</p>

<h2>Other Raspberry Pi Features</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi is a actual computer -- not much different than what's in 
a laptop computer or a cellphone -- and runs a full-featured Operating System.
When you're using the RaspberrySTEM Development Environment (RDE), you're simply
running an application on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>But, you can leave the RDE and use other features of the Raspberry Pi as 
well.  In this section, we'll talk about how to leave the RDE (and how to get 
back to it), as well as some of the things you can do outside the RDE.</p>

<h4>How to Get Out of the RDE</h4>

<p>When you exit from the RDE, you will be taken to a "desktop" environment
that looks similar to what you'd find on a typical desktop or laptop computer.
From here, you will see some clickable icons and pull-down menus.  This is 
the Raspian desktop, and it provides an interface to many of the other features
of the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>To get to the Raspian desktop from the RDE, simply press the following
three buttons all at the same time:</p>
<p>&lt;CRTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;D&gt;</p> 

<h4>How to Get Back to the RDE</h4>

<p>Once your on the Raspian desktop, you'll see an icon labeled, 
"RaspberrySTEM (RDE)".  If you double-click on that icon, it will bring you 
back to the RDE right where you left off.

<h2>More Resources to Check Out</h2>

<p>In 
	<a href="WHILE_LOOPS.html">WHILE LOOPS</a>, we discussed how <code>while</code>
loops can be used to cycle through code an indefinite (or even an
infinite) number of times.  But, what about when you only want
to cycle through a piece of code a specific number of times?
 For that, we can use another type of loop called <code>for</code>
loop.</p>
<p><code>for</code> loops allow you to cycle through a range of numbers, a
list of items or even through a string.  As an example, a <code>for</code>
loop can be used to simply iterate through a range of numbers, and
execute a statement (or set of statements) on each iteration:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
for x in range(5):
	print("This is time #", x, "through the loop.")
</textarea></div>

<p>If you ran that code, the output would be:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="output">
<div></div>
<pre>
This is time # 0 through the loop.
This is time # 1 through the loop.
This is time # 2 through the loop.
This is time # 3 through the loop.
This is time # 4 through the loop.
</pre>
</div>

<p>Essentially, the code ran through the code block 5 times, and
with each time through the loop, the loop variable (x) was set to the
current range value (0, 1, 2...).  You'll notice that the list starts counting at 0 not 1, and
this is a common convention in most all programming languages.
</p>
<p>
Here is another example:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
import time

print("The countdown has begun...")

for x in range(5, 0, -1):
	print(x)
	time.sleep(1)

print("BLAST OFF!!!")
</textarea></div>

<p>The output from this code would be:</p>

<div class="output">
<div></div>
<pre>
The countdown has begun...
5
4
3
2
1
BLAST OFF!!!
<span style="color: red;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice that for this loop, we using the range function in a different way.  If the range function
is passed 3 parameters, they should have the values 
<code>start</code>, 
<code>stop</code>, and
<code>step</code>: 
<ul>
<li><p>
<code>start</code> is the first value in the list.
</p></li><li><p>
<code>stop</code> is the value that ends the list (but it isn't included).
</p></li><li><p>
<code>step</code> is the value to add between one value and the next. 
When this third parameter isn't included, it defaults to "1" and the 
loop count increments by 1 each time through.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, <code>range(5, 0, -1)</code> could be read as "starting at 5, count down (step
-1) to 0 (but don't include the final 0)".
</p>

<p>We can also use for loops to iterate through the items in a
list.  Here's the example from
	the <a href="LISTS.html">LISTS</a> concept
-- a list of the
first five months of the year:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]
</textarea></div>

<p>We can use a for loop to iterate through each item in that
list and do what we want with it.  As a simple example, we can
print each item and also the number of letters it has:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]

for month in months:
	print(month, len(month))
</textarea></div>

<p>Here's the output from that code:</p>

<div class="output">
<div></div>
<pre>January 7
February 8
March 5
April 5
May 3
<span style="color: red;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span>
</pre>
</div>
