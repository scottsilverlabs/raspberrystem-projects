<h1>STRING THEORY</h1>
<p>Let’s talk
about "strings." When we talk about strings in programming,
we’re generally just talking about text. For example, in our very
first project, we printed out the text 'Hello, World!' &nbsp;In
this
example, 'Hello, World!' is a string.</p>
<p>In fact, a string is
any combination of letters, numbers and symbols that is used as text,
and we typically indicate something is a string by putting quotation
marks (') around it. Here are some examples of strings:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">'Hello,
World!'</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">'What is brown and sticky?
&nbsp;A stick!'</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">'4
score and 7 years ago.'</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">'1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">'My
name is Jason'</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">'1+1'</p>
<p>While some of those
strings contain numbers and other symbols, because they are each
surrounded by quotation marks, we treat them as a single group of
characters, exactly as they are. </p>
<p>For example, you
might look at that last string ('1+1') and think to yourself, "That is
the same as 2." While you’re obviously correct that
1+1 = 2, when the computer sees the quotation marks around that
string, it just thinks of it as a series of three characters put
together. &nbsp;But, if you're wondering how to get the computer to print the value of the calculation, check out <a href="CALCULATIONS.html">Calculations</a>.</p>
<p>Just to verify this,
let’s revisit our program from Project #1 and replace the string
'Hello, World!' with these other strings. While we could just
replace the 'Hello, World!' string with another one in line 1 and
re-run the program, we can also just add additional lines below line
1 with our new commands. Let’s take a look at how this would work…</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Step #1: Enter Your Code in The Code Window</h2>
<p>Starting on line 2
of the Code Window, add the following lines (you can either type them
in or cut-and-paste as we described in Project #1):</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="2">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
print('Hello, World!')
print('What is brown and sticky? A stick!')
print('4 score and 7 years ago.')
print('1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10')
print('My name is Jason')
print('1+1')
</textarea></div>
<br>
<h2>Step #2: Run Your Code</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve
entered all of your code into the Code Window, let’s see if it
works. To run the program, click on the Play icon in the Icon menu.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Step #3: Verify the "Output" of Your Code</h2>
<p>If you’ve done
everything correctly, you should see the following in your Output
Window:</p>
<div class="output" data-firstline="2">
<div> </div>
<pre>Hello, World!
Four score and seven years ago.
4 score and 7 years ago.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
My name is Jason
1+1
</pre></div>
</body></html>
