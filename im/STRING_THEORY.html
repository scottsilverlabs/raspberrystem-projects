  <h1>STRING THEORY</h1>

  <p>Let’s talk about "strings." When we talk about strings in programming,
  we’re generally just talking about text. For example, in the very first
  project, we printed out the text 'Hello, World!' In this example, 'Hello,
  World!' is a string.</p>

  <p>In fact, a string is any combination of letters, numbers and symbols that
  is used as text, and we typically indicate something is a string by putting
  quotation marks (') around it. Both single quotes (') and double quotes (")
  work just as well, as long as you are you use the same type of quotes on both
  ends of your string. Here are some examples of strings:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">'What is brown and sticky? A stick!' "What
  happens to a frog's car when it breaks down?" 'It gets toad away.' '4 score
  and 7 years ago.' '1+1'</p>

  <p>Two important notes about these strings:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>The second string above is surrounded by double quotes (") instead of
      single quotes ('). This wasn't just for fun. Double quotes are
      <i>required</i> because the string already contains a single quote (the
      apostrophe in “frog's”). To the computer, an apostrophe and a single
      quote are exactly the same thing! If single quotes were used instead of
      double quotes, the program would think the string ended after the word
      “frog”, which obviously is not correct.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>You might look at that last string ('1+1') and think to yourself,
      "That is the same as 2." While you’re obviously correct that 1+1 = 2,
      when the computer sees the quotation marks around that string, it just
      thinks of it as a series of three characters put together. If you're
      wondering how to get the computer to print the value of the calculation,
      check out <a href="CALCULATIONS.html">CALCULATIONS</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Step #1: Enter Your Code in The Code Window</h4>

  <p>Starting with a blank Code Window (you can create a new file, if needed),
  enter the following lines:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
print('What is brown and sticky? A stick!')
print("What happens to a frog's car when it breaks down?")
print('It gets toad away.')
print('4 score and 7 years ago.')
print('1+1')
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h4>Step #2: Run Your Code</h4>

  <p>To run the program, click on the Play icon at the top of the Code
  Window.</p>
  <h4>Step #3: Verify the Output of Your Code</h4>

  <p>If you’ve done everything correctly, you should see the following in your
  Output Window:</p>
  <div class="output">
    <pre>
What is brown and sticky? A stick!
What happens to a frog's car when it breaks down?
It gets toad away.
4 score and 7 years ago.
1+1
</pre>
  </div>
