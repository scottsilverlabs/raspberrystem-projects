<p>You're probably familiar with the game Space Invaders, which
was
originally made popular in the 1970s in arcades and on the Atari (one of the
first home
gaming systems).  When it first came out, this game was pretty
revolutionary.
</p>
<p>Over the next 10 projects, we're going to
build a basic version of Space Invaders using the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit
components we've already wired up.  The LED Matrix will be
used to
display the graphics, the accelerometer will be used to control the
left and right movement of the ship (by tilting the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit left
or right) and the button will be used to fire missiles at the invading
aliens.  
By the time we've
completed this project, you should have
the basic skills necessary to build more complex games.
</p>
<p>Like most games you'll build, this one
is going to start with a game loop, and in this first Space Invaders
project, we'll
start by writing the pseudo-code for our game loop (see <a href="GAME_LOOPS.html">GAME LOOPS</a> for more
information on both pseudo-code and game loops).  In our
experience, the best way to write pseudo-code is in an iterative
process, meaning that we write the very high level steps out first, and
then we break each of those steps into smaller chunks with more
details.  We continue doing this until we have enough detail
that
we're ready to actually start writing our code.</p>
<h2>Our Game Loop</h2>
<p>Let's start with the basic outline for any game loop, much as
we
described in <a href="GAME_LOOPS.html">GAME LOOPS</a>:</p>


<pre>
Initialize the game environment

while (game not finished):
	Check for user input
	Update the game world
	Draw graphics on the screen
	Wait for some period of time

Finish & Cleanup
</pre>
<p>Now, let's look at each of these areas individually...</p>

<h2>Initialize the game environment</h2>
<p>This
is where we're going to initialize all of the components and game
elements that we'll be using throughout our game.  In our
Space
Invaders implementation, the three major components we'll have are the
ship that we control ("spaceship"), the alien ships that we try to
destroy ("aliens") and the missiles that we fire from our spaceship at
the aliens ("missiles").  We'll need to initialize the design,
position and other aspects of each of those components, as well as
general setup, like importing the functions we'll need and
initializing the framebuffer.</p>
<p>
Here's a general overview of what this part of the code will look like:</p>
<pre>
# Initialize the game environment
Import required functions/modules
Initialize framebuffer
Initialize accelerometer
Initialize spaceship
Initialize aliens
Initialize missiles
</pre>


<p>There
will be other details that we'll add in there as well, but these are
the big items we'll need to address in our initialization code.</p>

<h2>while (game not finished):</h2>
<p>This will be the start of our game loop.  For this
game, we'll
loop continuously until the game is completed (either you destroy all
the aliens or they get to the bottom of the screen and destroy you), at
which point we can break from our while loop.</p>
<p>So, our loop will just be:</p>
<pre>
while True:
</pre>
<h2>Check for user input</h2>
<p>Unlike
our previous game loops, for this game we'll be taking user input.
 Specifically, we'll be reading data from the accelerometer to
know which direction the game is being tilted and we'll be checking the
button to determine if a missile was fired.   This part of the
code will look something like:</p>
<pre>
# Check for user input
Get accelerometer input
Get button input
</pre>

<h2>Update the game world</h2>
<p>Each time through the loop, we'll have to update the status of
all
the three major components of the game -- the spaceship, the aliens and
the missiles.  In addition, we'll want to test to see if any of
the
previously launched missiles has collided with an alien.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this section of the code will look something
like:</p>
<pre>
# Update the game world
Update the location of the spaceship
Update the location of the aliens
Update the location of any missiles
Check for any missile collisions
</pre>
<p>
Now that we have updated information for each of the components of our
game, it's time to update the graphics based on the new information.
 This involves erasing the framebuffer, writing the new
graphics
to the framebuffer and then showing the revised framebuffer.
 Here's what that will look like in our code:</p>
<pre>
# Draw graphics on the screen
Erase the framebuffer
Draw the spaceship
Draw the aliens
Draw any missiles
Show the framebuffer
</pre>
<h2>Wait for some period of time</h2>
<p>At the end of our game loop, we need to include a pause before
continuing our next round through the loop.  For this game,
our
graphics aren't going to (necessarily) update each time through the
loop, so our wait time doesn't need to be correlated to our graphics
updates.  That said, we need to pick a time that is not too
long
-- otherwise the graphics will be as responsive as we'd like -- and
also not too short -- or we'll needlessly overwork the processor.</p>
<p>We'll
play around with various wait times and see what works, but typically,
we'd expect something in the .001 to .1 seconds time frame...</p>
<pre>
# Wait for some period of time
Wait for between .001 and .01 seconds
</pre>
<h2>Finish &amp; Cleanup</h2>
<p>Finally, we need to handle the case where we fall through the
loop,
either because we've won the game (destroyed all the aliens) or lost
the game (the aliens got to the bottom of the screen).  In
either
case, we'll at least print the final game status (win or lose) to the
output window.
</p>
<pre>
# Finish &amp; Cleanup
Print "You won!" if the player wins
Print "You lost..." if the player loses
</pre>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>Here
is what the full pseudo-code for this game will look like... we'll spend
the next projects building it piece-by-piece:</p>
<pre>
# Initialize the game environment
Import required functions/modules
Initialize framebuffer
Initialize accelerometer
Initialize spaceship
Initialize aliens
Initialize missiles

while True:
    # Check for user input
    Get accelerometer input
    Get button input

    # Update the game world
    Update the location of the spaceship
    Update the location of the aliens
    Update the location of any missiles
    Check for any missile collisions

    # Draw graphics on the screen
    Erase the framebuffer
    Draw the spaceship
    Draw the aliens
    Draw any missiles
    Show the framebuffer

    # Wait for some period of time
    Wait for between .001 and .01 seconds

# Finish &amp; Cleanup
Print "You won!" if the player wins
Print "You lost..." if the player loses

</pre>
