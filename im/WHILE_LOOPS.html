<h1>WHILE LOOPS</h1>
<p>While loops are used for the purpose of having your program repeat a certain piece of code
over and over until for as long as some specific condition is met (or until some condition
is met).</p>  

<p>While loops are used as follows:</p>

<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
while (expression):
	If expression is True, execute this code block
	.
	.
	.
	Go back to the top of the loop and test expression again

When expression is False, continue here...
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>As an example, imagine you want to write some code to build a countdown timer.  The 
code would start at a specified number of seconds (let's say 60), and then count backwards 
-- once per second -- until the timer reached zero.  At that point, an alarm would go off.</p>

<p>The code for this application is pretty simple:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a variable (let's call it <i>time_left</i>) and set it to 60.</li>
	<li>Check whether the <i>time_left</i> has reached 0.</li>
	<li>If <i>time_left</i> has reached 0, jump to Step #6.</li>
	<li>Subtract 1 from <i>time_left</i></li>
	<li>Go back to Step #2 
	<li>Sound the alarm!</li>
</ol>

<p>You'll notice that Steps #2-5 will repeat many times (60, to be exact) before our variable
gets to 0 and we jump to Step #6. The easiest way to implement that repeating code is to use
a while loop, as follows:</p>

<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
time_left = 60

while (time_left != 0):
	time_left -= 1

sound_the_alarm()
</textarea></div>
<br>

<p>In our code above, the first line sets our variable <i>time_left</i> to 60.</p>
<p>Next, we use a while loop to test whether <i>time_left</i> equals 0 or not.  If the
expression <i>(time_left != 0)</i> tests true (i.e., we haven't yet gotten to zero), we
subtract 1 from <i>time_left</i> and go back to the top to test the expression again.</p>
<p>We continue this loop until the expression tests False (i.e., our variable gets to 0), 
at which point we drop through the loop and start executing the code below it.</p>

<p>The most basic while loop is one that will execute forever.
In fact, that's the point of it -- it will keep going until
someone explicitly stops the program. </p>
<p>It is written as follows:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
while True:
	CODE BLOCK HERE
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Because the expression "True" always evaluates to True, this
code block will loop over and over forever until the program is stopped
by the user.</p>
<p>One more thing to note -- sometimes we want to break out of a loop while we're in the middle
of executing the code block, even if the expression that we were testing still tests True.
This can be accomplished by using the <i>break</i> keyword from within the loop, and will
immediately drop through the loop to the code below.</p>
