  <h1>WHILE LOOPS</h1>

  <p><code>while</code> loops allow your program to repeat a certain piece of code over and
  over as long as some specific condition is met.</p>

  <p><code>while</code> loops are used as follows:</p>
  <pre>
while (expression):
    If expression is True, execute this code block
    .
    .
    .
    Go back to the top of the loop and test expression again

When expression is False, continue here...
</pre>

  <p>As an example, imagine you want to write some code to build a countdown
  timer. The code would start at a specified number of seconds (let's say 60),
  and then count backwards -- once per second -- until the timer reached zero.
  At that point, an alarm would go off.</p>

  <p>The code for this application is pretty simple:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>Create a variable (let's call it <code>time_left</code>) and set it to
      60.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>If <code>time_left</code> has reached 0, jump to Step #5.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Subtract 1 from <code>time_left</code> and wait a second.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Go back to Step #2</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Sound the alarm!</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>You'll notice that Steps #2-4 will repeat many times (60, to be exact)
  before our variable gets to 0 and we jump to Step #6. The easiest way to
  implement that repeating code is to use a <code>while</code> loop, as follows:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
time_left = 60

while (time_left &gt; 0):
        time_left -= 1
    time.sleep(1)

sound_the_alarm()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In our code above, the first line sets our variable <code>time_left</code>
  to 60.</p>

  <p>Next, we use a <code>while</code> loop to test whether <code>time_left</code> equals 0
  or not. If the expression <code>(time_left &gt; 0)</code> tests true (i.e.,
  we haven't yet gotten to zero), we subtract 1 from <code>time_left</code> and
  go back to the top to test the expression again.</p>

  <p>We continue this loop until the expression tests False (i.e., our variable
  gets to 0), at which point we drop through the loop and start executing the
  code below it.</p>

  <p>The most basic <code>while</code> loop is one that will execute forever. In fact,
  that's the point of it -- it will keep going until someone explicitly stops
  the program.</p>

  <p>It is written as follows:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
while True:
        CODE BLOCK HERE
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Because the expression "True" always evaluates to True, this code block
  will loop over and over forever until the program is stopped by the user.</p>

  <p>One more thing to note -- sometimes we want to break out of a loop while
  we're in the middle of executing the code block, even if the expression that
  we were testing still tests True. This can be accomplished by using the
  <code>break</code> keyword from within the loop, and will immediately drop
  through the loop to the code below.</p>
