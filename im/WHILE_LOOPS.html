<h1>WHILE LOOPS</h1>
<p>while loops are somewhat similar to if statements in that they
evaluate an expression to determine if that express is True or False.
&nbsp;if statements will evaluate an expression a single time, and
if the expression is True, the if statement will execute a code block.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, while loops will evaluate an expression,
and if the expression is True, the while loop will execute a code block
and then go back and start over. &nbsp;If will evaluate the
expression again, and if the expression is still True, it will execute
the code block again. &nbsp;It will do this until either the
expression is no longer True, or until something in the code block says
to STOP!</p>
<p>The most basic while loop is one that will execute forever.
&nbsp;In fact, that's the point of it -- it will keep going until
someone explicitly stops the program. &nbsp;It is written as
follows:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
while True:
CODE BLOCK HERE
</textarea></div>
<p></p>
<p>Because the expression "True" always evaluates to True, this
code block will loop over and over forever until the program is stopped
by the user.</p>
