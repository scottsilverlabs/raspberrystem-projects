  <p>Ohm's law, discussed in <a data-uid="circuits"></a>, gives the relationship between voltage,
  current and resistance.  In this project, we'll test it.  Specifically, we'll take our LED
  circuit:</p><img class="schematic" style=
  "width: 200px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png" alt="">
  <p>and we'll adjust the voltage and resistance to see how it affects the
  current.

  <p>To understand this, you have to understand a teensy bit more about how the
  LED works.  Ideally, it acts simply as a wire that lights up
  if there is current running through it.  The more current that runs through
      it, the brighter it gets (up to a point - too much current, and it will
      break).  
      
    <p>In addition, the current thought an LED will only flow in one direction,
      which is the direction of the arrow (we saw this was true in <a
      data-uid="yfc"></a>, when we flipped the LED backwards to saw that it
      didn't light up).  In this project, we'll only be running the current in
      one direction (because we <i>do</i> want it to light up!).

<p>Remeber, Ohm's law is:
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-size: 150%;">
<strong><i>Voltage</i></strong> = <strong><i>Current</i></strong> &middot; <strong><i>Resistance</i></strong>
<p>which means that, for a given resistance, if we double the voltage the current will double.
And,
if the current doubles in our circuit above, the LED will be brighter.
<p>Alternatively, it means that for a given voltage, if you double the resistance, the current will
be cut in half.
And,
if the current is halved in our circuit above, the LED will be dimmer.

  <p>To build this circuit, you'll build two identical LED circuits.  Then,
  we'll experiment with changing the voltage and resistance.</p>
  <h3 class=step>Build two identical LED circuits.</h3>

  <p>These two circuits are equivalent to the circuits we've previously built.
  Both LEDs should be just as bright as they were before.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>We added the button in at the end of our circuit (after the LED and resistor).  What
      happens if you add it before the LED and resistor?  Why or why not?
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Similarly, can you add the resistor into our circuit in between the
      LED and resistor?  Why or why not?
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We used two additional short green wires to hook up the button.  Can
      you hook it up without any additional green wires?
