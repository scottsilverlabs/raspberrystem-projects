  <div class="hw" data-count="1" data-name="resistor_yfc"></div>
<div class=section id=intro>
  <p>Similar to the <a data-uid="tweak"></a> project, lets look further at the LED circuit:
  </p><img class="schematic" style=
  "width: 200px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png" alt="">
  <p>Previously, we swapped out the resistor in the circuit to change the
  current (which changed the brightness of the LED). Now, we can use our
  knowledge of series and parallel circuits to swap out the resistor for more
  than one resistor, in different combinations of series and parallel.

</div>
<div class=section id=hw>

  <p>To build this circuit, you'll again start with two identical LED circuits.
  Then, we'll experiment with changing the voltage and resistance.</p>
  <h3 class=step>Build two identical LED circuits.</h3>

  <p>Build two LED circuits that are equivalent to the circuits we've previously built.  Both LED circuits
  will use the 100 ohm resistor:
  <img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png"
  alt="">
  Both LEDs should be just as bright as they were before.
  <h3 class=step>Put two resistors in series.</h3>

  <p>For one of the circuits (we've chosen the circuit on the right in the
  diagram below), change
  the resistor from a single 100 ohms to two 100 ohms resistors in series:
  <img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png"
  alt="">
  <p>This will increase the resistance which will decrease the current, which
  makes the LED dimmer.  Note that, compared to the last project, the
  difference in brightness will be slight (we used a large difference in
  resistance last project)

  <h3 class=step>Put two resistors in parallel.</h3>
  <p>For one of the circuits (we've chosen the circuit on the right in the
  diagram below), rewire the two series resistors as two resistors in parallel:
  <img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png"
  alt="">
  <p>This will decrease the resistance which will increase the current, which
  makes the LED brighter.
  Again note that the difference in brightness will be slight.

</div>
<div class=section id=challenge>
  <p>The <strong>Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong> includes four
  100 ohm resistors (in addition to the 470 ohms and 1000 ohms resistors).  The following
  challenges will modify your LED/resistor circuit:
  <ol>
    <li>
  <p>Compare four 100 ohm resistors in series to one 470 ohm.  Is there any
  noticble difference in brightness?

    </li>
    <li>
  <p>Add 100 ohm resistors in parallel, one at a time, until there are four in
  parallel.  Notice the brightness change as each one is added (each new
  resistor can be added in parallel while the LED is on, so you will see the
  brightness change right as each resistor is added).

    </li>
    <li>
  <p>Put a 100 ohm resistor in <i>parallel</i> with a 1000 ohm resistor.  How does the brightness compare
  to a 100 ohm resistor alone or a 1000 ohm resistor alone?  Why?

    </li>
    <li>
  <p>Put a 100 ohm resistor in <i>series</i> with a 1000 ohm resistor.  How does the brightness compare
  to a 100 ohm resistor alone or a 1000 ohm resistor alone?  Why?

    </li>
