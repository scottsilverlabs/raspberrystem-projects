<h1>FUNCTION OUTPUTS</h1>
<p>In the previous lesson, we talked about how functions can take
inputs to allow them
to do customized tasks. But, not only can functions take inputs,
they can also send information back (return output) to other parts of
the code. A good example of this is when we have a function that
does some calculations for us, and we want to get the results of
those calculations.</p>
<p>Perhaps instead of
printing the name and birth year of people, we’d rather know how
old the person will be on their birthday this year. Using the
information we already have from our previous lesson, this
calculation is pretty simple – we just subtract the birth year from
the current year (2015 as of this writing) and we’ll get the age
they will be turning this year.</p>
<p>To create a new
function to do this, we can still pass in the “year” parameter
for the person’s birth year (like we did in the previous project)
but, instead of printing the information, we do our age calculation
and store the resulting value in a new variable called “age”. </p>
<p>This is what the
function would look like:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
def calculate_age(birth_year):
	age = 2015 - birth_year
</textarea></div>
<p><b>Note: </b>This
is the reason we decided to keep the “year” parameter as a number
instead of a string in the previous lesson -- so that we could use it
to perform this
calculation.</p>
<p>Now, to send the
information we’ve calculated back to the main program, we end the
function with a return statement that contains the information we’re
sending back (in this case, we’re sending the information contained
in the variable, “age”):</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
def calculate_age(birth_year):
	age = 2015 - birth_year
	return age
</textarea></div>
<p>The value of “age”
would then be returned to where the function was called and that
value could be stored in another variable, printed or used however it
is needed.</p>
<p>For example, we
could call this function for Bob and Susie like we did in the last
project, but this time, we could get their age as well, store it in a
variable and then print it out:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="5">
<div></div>
<textarea>
bob_age = calculate_age(1992)
susie_age = calculate_age(1985)

print('This year, Bob will be ', bob_age)
print('This year, Susie will be ', susie_age)
</textarea></div>
<p>Here is what the
entire program would look like:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
def calculate_age(birth_year):
	age = 2015 - birth_year
	return age

bob_age = calculate_age(1992)
susie_age = calculate_age(1985)

print('This year, Bob will be ', bob_age)
print('This year, Susie will be ', susie_age)
</textarea></div>

<p>There's only one more function lesson you need to be familiar
with before jumping back into the project. &nbsp;We promise...just
one more! &nbsp;Here you go:&nbsp; <a href="BUILT-IN_FUNCTIONS.html">USING FUNCTIONS &
