<h1>FOR LOOPS</h1>
<p>We've already discussed how <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span>
loops can be used to cycle through code an indefinite (or even an
infinite) number of times. &nbsp;But, what about when you only want
to cycle though a piece of code a specific number of times?
&nbsp;For that, we can use another type of loop called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">for</span>
loop.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">for
</span>loops allow you to cycle through a range of numbers, a
list of items or even through a string. &nbsp;As an example, a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">for</span>
loop can be used to simply iterate through a range of numbers, and
execute a statement (or set of statements) on each iteration:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
for x in range(1, 5)
    print("This is time #", x, "through the loop.")
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>If you ran that code, the output would be:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="output">
<div></div>
<pre>This is time # 1 through the loop.<br>This is time # 2 through the loop.<br>This is time # 3 through the loop.<br>This is time # 4 through the loop.<br>This is time # 5 through the loop.<br></pre>
</div>
<br>
<p>Essentially, the code ran through the code block 5 times, and
with each time through the loop, the loop variable (x) was set to the
current range value (1, 2, 3...). &nbsp; There is no reason the
range needed to run from 1 to 5; it could have just as easily run from
10 to 20. <!-- Or even from 20 to 10! --><br>
<br>
Here is another example:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
import time

print("The countdown has begun...")
for x in range(5, 1):
    print(x)
    time.sleep(1)
print("BLAST OFF!!!")
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>The output from this code would be:</p>
<br>
<div class="output">
<div></div>
<pre>The countdown has begun...<br>5<br>4<br>3<br>2<br>1<br>BLAST OFF!!!<br><span style="color: red;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span><br></pre>
</div>
<p>We can also use for loops to iterate through the items in a
list. &nbsp;Here's the example list we saw earlier -- a list of the
first five months of the year:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>We can use a for loop to iterate through each item in that
list and do what we want with it. &nbsp;As a simple example, we can
print each item and also the number of letters it has:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]
for month in months:
    print(month, len(month))
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Here's the output from that code:</p>
<br>
<div class="output">
<div></div>
<pre>January 7<br>February 8<br>March 5<br>April 5<br>May 3<br><span style="color: red;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span><br></pre>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span>
</body></html>
