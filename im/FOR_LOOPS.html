  <h1>FOR LOOPS</h1>

  <p>In <a href="WHILE_LOOPS.html">WHILE LOOPS</a>, we discussed how
  <code>while</code> loops can be used to cycle through code an indefinite (or
  even an infinite) number of times. But, what about when you only want to
  cycle through a piece of code a specific number of times? For that, we can
  use another type of loop called <code>for</code> loop.</p>

  <p><code>for</code> loops allow you to cycle through a range of numbers, a
  list of items or even through a string. As an example, a <code>for</code>
  loop can be used to simply iterate through a range of numbers, and execute a
  statement (or set of statements) on each iteration:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
for x in range(5):
        print("This is time #", x, "through the loop.")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you ran that code, the output would be:</p>
  <div class="output">
    <pre>
This is time # 0 through the loop.
This is time # 1 through the loop.
This is time # 2 through the loop.
This is time # 3 through the loop.
This is time # 4 through the loop.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Essentially, the code ran through the code block 5 times, and with each
  time through the loop, the loop variable (x) was set to the current range
  value (0, 1, 2...). You'll notice that the list starts counting at 0 not 1,
  and this is a common convention in most all programming languages.</p>

  <p>Here is another example:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
import time

print("The countdown has begun...")

for x in range(5, 0, -1):
        print(x)
        time.sleep(1)

print("BLAST OFF!!!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The output from this code would be:</p>
  <div class="output">
    <pre>
The countdown has begun...
5
4
3
2
1
BLAST OFF!!!
<span style="color: red;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Notice that for this loop, we using the range function in a different way.
  If the range function is passed 3 parameters, they should have the values
  <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>step</code>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p><code>start</code> is the first value in the list.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><code>stop</code> is the value that ends the list (but it isn't
      included).</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><code>step</code> is the value to add between one value and the next.
      When this third parameter isn't included, it defaults to "1" and the loop
      count increments by 1 each time through.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In other words, <code>range(5, 0, -1)</code> could be read as "starting at
  5, count down (step -1) to 0 (but don't include the final 0)".</p>

  <p>We can also use for loops to iterate through the items in a list. Here's
  the example from the <a href="LISTS.html">LISTS</a> concept -- a list of the
  first five months of the year:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>We can use a for loop to iterate through each item in that list and do
  what we want with it. As a simple example, we can print each item and also
  the number of letters it has:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]

for month in months:
        print(month, len(month))
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here's the output from that code:</p>
  <div class="output">
    <pre>
January 7
February 8
March 5
April 5
May 3
<span style="color: red;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span>
</pre>
  </div>
  <p class="nextprev"><a href="index.html">home</a></p>
</body>
</html>
