<p>In this project we'll be adding a new input device -- the 
pushbutton (or just "button").  A button is just a very simple switch – electric current can flow
through it only when it is pressed.  </p>
<p>Take one of the buttons out of your 
<strong>I/O (Input/Output) RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong> so we can take a closer look at how a button works.  
This is a representation of most basic pushbuttons – they have four “legs”
that can be attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit and
then one button in the center of the device that can be pushed
(“closed”) or released (“open”):</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 200px;" alt="" src="img/button1%20cropped.jpg">
<p>Internally, the left side of the
button (the two legs on the
left) are connected together, and the right side of the button (the two
legs on
the right) are connected together:
</p>
<img style="width: 402px;" alt="" src="img/button2%20cropped.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_243">
<p>When we insert a button into a circuit, it has one of two
operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open
circuit, no electric current can flow through the button and nothing
happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and
closes the circuit – electric current can then flow through the button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if we go back to our first
breadboard circuit containing
a simple resistor and LED that is always illuminated, we should be able
to add
a switch that we can then use to control the LED turning on and off (by
pressing the button).</p>
<p>Let’s build that circuit now…</p>
<p>Here’s what the schematic will look
like:
<img class="schematic" style="width:200px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-With-Button.png">  
<p>To build the circuit, let's start with the circuit we built in the last project --
	<a href="RASPBERRY_PI_POWER.html">GETTING POWER FROM THE RASPBERRY PI</a>:</p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png">

<h4>Step #1: Remove wire from LED to ground.</h4>
<p>We’re going to be adding the button
into the circuit between
the LED and ground, so the first step will be to remove the wire that
connects
the LED to ground.  </p>
<p>This is what the breadboard should
look like at this point:</p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_1_bb.png">

<h4>Step #2: Provide connectivity from the LED to the button.</h4>
<p>The next step is to provide connectivity between the second lead of
the LED and the button.  You can wire the button directly to the LED, but to space the parts out a
little more, we're going to first add an additional wire (one of the the half-inch green
wires).
</p><p>This is what the breadboard should
look like at this point:</p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_2_bb.png">
<h4>Step #3: Place button on the breadboard.</h4>
<p>Next, we’ll place the button on the
breadboard.    Note
that the button should be oriented so
that the two sides of the button sit on different connect strips, as follows:    </p>
<table style="margin: auto; width: 70%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/Button_orientation_correct.png"></td>
<td><img src="img/Button_orientation_wrong.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>CORRECT</strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="color: red;">WRONG!!!</span></strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One side of the button should sit in the same connect strip as
the green wire from the LED.  This will provide connectivity from
the LED through the green wire and to the button, as follows:</p><p>   </p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_3_bb.png">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  In our diagram
above, you'll notice that the button sits across a notch in the
breadboard.  This isn't absolutely necessary -- the button could
sit with both left legs in the same connect strip and both right legs
in the same connect strip.  But, because buttons take up a lot of
space on the breadboard, we find it easier to position them across a
notch in many cases.  You can decide how you want to wire your
buttons, but keep in mind that either way will work.
<h4>Step #4: Connect the other side of the button to ground.</h4>
<p> Finally,
we can
complete the circuit by connecting the other side of the button to
ground, like
this:  </p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_4_bb.png">
<p> At this
point, your
LED should <strong>not</strong> be lit.   Remember,
while
we have a <span style="font-style: italic;">potentially</span>
complete circuit, there is still a lack of physical
connection through the button until the button is pressed.
In other words, there is a break in the circuit <i>inside</i> the button (this
is how a button works) and the way to complete the circuit is to press
the button.</p><p> If you press the button,
you should see the
LED illuminate.</p>
<div class="info">
<div>"Breaking the Circuit"</div>
<div>
<p>
In this project, we controlled the flow of electric current
through the circuit by inserting a switch (the button) between the LED
and ground.
That said, the switch didn't need to be inserted at that point in the
circuit for it to work -- we could have inserted the switch anywhere in
the circuit
and it would have worked the exact same way. Remember, if the flow of
electric charge is broken anywhere
in the circuit, the circuit will fail to
operate. So, our decision to insert the button where we did was
completely arbitrary. 
</p>
</div></div>
<p>Congratulations - you’ve just built the same circuit used in most simple flashlights!</p>
<p>
In the next project, we’ll add software into the equation, and will start using "GPIOs"
to control our output.</p>
