  <h1>Open and Closed Circuits</h1>

  <p>An <strong>open circuit</strong> is a circuit that does not form a complete
  conducting loop.  Of course, by definition, it's not a circuit at all, as
  electric charge can't flow around a loop that is broken.  If an open circuit
  is connected together to complete the circuit, then we have a <strong>closed
  circuit</strong>
  - that is, a circuit that forms a closed loop around which electric charge
  can flow.  Most often, though, there's no need to refer to a circuit as
  "closed", as any working circuit is closed.

<p>If you took the lightbulb circuit from <a data-uid="electronics"></a>, and
cut a wire, you'll have created an open circuit, and current will stop flowing:
  <p><mark>PIC: Animation of lightbulb circuit being cut.

  <p>A <strong>short circuit</strong> is what happens when one part of a
  circuit is connected by a conductor <i>unintentionally</i> to another part of
  the circuit.  Electric charge can then flow through a part of the circuit
  that it was not intended to.  For example, in the battery and LED circuit in
  previous projects, attaching a wire from power to ground with nothing in
  between will cause large amounts of electricity to flow
  through that wire (instead of the LED as intended). This can dissipate your
  power source very quickly, or worst-case (for larger power sources than the
  battery we used), the flow of current can heat up the wire to the point
  where it breaks or causes a fire.</p>

  <h1>Pushing your buttons</h1>
  <p>The pushbutton (or
  just "button") is just a very simple switch – electric current can
  flow through it only when it is pressed.</p>

  <p>Take one of the buttons out of your <strong>I/O (Input/Output)
  RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong> so we can take a closer look at how a button
  works. This is a representation of most basic pushbuttons – they have four
  “legs” that can be attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit and
  then one button in the center of the device that can be pushed (“closed”) or
  released (“open”).  When it is pushed closed, a small metal disk pushes into
  the legs of the button, connecting all four metal legs together.

  <p>Internally, the left side of the button (the two legs on the left) are
  connected together, and the right side of the button (the two legs on the
  right) are connected together:</p>
  <p><mark>Replace drawing below with button used in breadboard diagrams
  <img style="width: 202px;" alt="" src= "img/button2%20cropped.jpg">
  <p>The dashed lines above show the internal wires that permanently connect
  some of the legs together.  So, when using a button, you'll generally want to
  just use two of the legs - either the top two, or the bottom two.

  sideways view of button.

  <p>When we insert a button into a circuit, it has one of two operations:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open circuit, no
      electric current can flow through the button and nothing happens.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and closes the
      circuit – electric current can then flow through the button.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
