<div>Learning About Circuit Input/Output</div>
<div>
<p>
Now that we've built our first circuit on the breadboard and have it being powered by the
Raspberry Pi, it's time to start controlling that circuit.  We do this through mechanisms
called "input" and "output".  
the input and output of a circuit.
</p>

<p>
Input is information we receive from the outside world that gives us an idea of what our
circuit should do next.  For example, when you press a button on a TV remote control, it 
tells your television to do something (change the channel, increase the volume, etc).  
The remote control is called an "input device."  There are lots of different types of input
devices that circuits can use, and button input is one of the most common.
the input and output of a circuit.
</p>

<p>
Output is information that your circuit provides back to you.  Output comes in many different
forms, and common forms of output are things that can be picked up by your senses --
for example, lights and displays that you can see or buzzers that you can hear.  
But, output can also be in the form of motors/movement (for example, a robot or a remote 
controlled car) or in the form that you can't detect without specialized equipment (infra-red
light, for example).
the input and output of a circuit.
</p>

<p>
Any interesting circuit is going to take input and provide output, and the circuits we'll be
building with the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit are no different.  Over the next several projects,
we're going to work with two very common forms of input and output -- we'll be using 
pushbuttons for input and our LEDs for output.
the input and output of a circuit.
</p>

<p>
Each of the next several projects will provide more complex and interesting ways in which we
can control circuits with input and output.  Here is what we plan to do:
the input and output of a circuit.
</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>In this project (Project #5), we will add a pushbutton input to the circuit 
	that we've already assembled on our breadboard.  The circuit input (the pushbutton) 
	and output (the LED) will work strictly using hardware -- there will be no software
       involved in the control of the circuit.</li>
       <li><p>In Project #6, we'll learn how to use software to control our output
	device (LED).</li>
	<li><p>Then, in Project #7, we'll learn how to get input from our
	input device (pushbutton) to our software.</li>
	<li><p>Finally, in Project #8, we'll put it all together and use the pushbutton input 
	into our software to control the LED output.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In other words, over the next three projects, we will go from using getting input and
displaying output strictly through hardware to using software to monitor and control
the input and output of a circuit.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As we mentioned above, in this project we'll be adding a new input device -- the 
pushbutton (or just "button").  A button is just a very simple switch – when it’s 
not pressed, electric current can't flow through the button
and when it is pressed, electric current does flow through the button.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at how a button works.&nbsp; This
is a
representation of most basic pushbuttons – they have four “legs”
that can be attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit and
then one button in the center of the device that can be un-pushed
(“open”) or pushed (“closed”):</p>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style=""></span><o:p></o:p><img style="width: 377px; height: 534px;" alt="" src="img/button1%20cropped.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p>Internally, the left side of the
button (the two legs on the
left) are connected together, and the right side of the button (the two
legs on
the right) are connected together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The
left side and the right side are separated by a switch that opens and
closes as
the button is pressed or unpressed:<o:p></o:p></p>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style=""><img style="height: 637px; width: 402px;" alt="" src="img/button2%20cropped.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_243"></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<br>
<p>When we insert a button into a circuit, it has one of two
operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open
circuit, no electric current can flow through the button and nothing
happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and
closes the circuit – electric current can then flow through the button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, if we go back to our first
breadboard circuit containing
a simple resistor and LED that is always illuminated, we should be able
to add
a switch that we can then use to control the LED turning on and off (by
pressing the button).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let’s build that circuit now…<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here’s what the schematic will look
like:
<br>
<br>
<img class="schematic" style="width:200px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-With-Button.png" width="200">  
<br>
<p>To build the circuit, let's start with the circuit we built in the last project --
	<a href="RASPBERRY_PI_POWER.html">RASPBERRY PI POWER</a>:</p>
<br>
<img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png">
<br>

<p><b>Step #1: Remove wire from LED to ground.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We’re going to be adding the button
into the circuit between
the LED and ground, so the first step will be to remove the wire that
connects
the LED to ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is what the breadboard should
look like at this point:<o:p></o:p></p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_1_bb.png">
<br>

<p><b>Step #2: Provide connectivity from the LED to the button.</b></p>
<p>The next step is to provide connectivity between the second lead of
the LED and the button. &nbsp;While we could wire the button in the
same connect row as the LED to provide this connectivity, the buttons
take up a good bit of space in a connect row, and it would be hard to
fit the LED, the button and the wires we'll need all in the same row.
&nbsp;For that reason, we suggest running a wire (the half-inch green
wires work great for this) from the connect strip that the LED is in to
a new connect strip that we can use for the button.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Assuming you choose to do it this way, this is what the breadboard should
look like at this point:<o:p></o:p></p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_2_bb.png">
<br>
<p><b>Step #3: Place button on the breadboard.</b></p>
<p>Next, we’ll place the button on the
breadboard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note
that the button should be oriented so
that the two sides of the button sit on different connect strips, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<br>
<table style="margin: auto; width: 70%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/Button_orientation_correct.png" width="285"></td>
<td><img src="img/Button_orientation_wrong.png" width="285"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>CORRECT</b></td>
<td><b><span style="color: red;">WRONG!!!</span></b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br><br><p>One side of the button should sit in the same connect row as
the green wire from the LED. &nbsp;This will provide connectivity from
the LED through the green wire and to the button, as follows:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_3_bb.png">
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> &nbsp;In our diagram
above, you'll notice that the button sits across a notch in the
breadboard. &nbsp;This isn't absolutely necessary -- the button could
sit with both left legs in the same connect strip and both right legs
in the same connect strip. &nbsp;But, because buttons take up a lot of
space on the breadboard, we find it easier to position them across a
notch in many cases. &nbsp;You can decide how you want to wire your
buttons, but keep in mind that either way will work.
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Step #4: Connect the other side of the button to ground.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Finally,
we can
complete the circuit by connecting the other side of the button to
ground, like
this: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_4_bb.png">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">At this
point, your
LED should not be lit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remember,
while
we have a&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">potentially</span>
complete circuit, there is still a lack of physical
connection through the button until the button is pressed.<span style="">&nbsp;
In other words, there is a break in the circuit <i>inside</i> the button (this
is how a button works) and the way to complete the circuit is to press
the button.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style=""></span>If you press the button,
you should see the
LED illuminate.</p>
<br>
<div class="info">
<div>"Breaking the Circuit"</div>
<div>
<p>
In this project, we controlled the flow of electric current
through the circuit by inserting a switch (the button) between the LED
and ground.
That said, the switch didn't need to be inserted at that point in the
circuit for it to work -- we could have inserted the switch anywhere in
the circuit
and it would have worked the exact same way. Remember, if the flow of
electric charge is broken anywhere
in the circuit, the circuit will fail to
operate. So, our decision to insert the button where we did was
completely arbitrary. 
</p>
</div></div>
<br>
<p>In this
project,
we’ve manipulated the circuit using a purely physical device.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By inserting the button
into the circuit, we
can interrupt the flow of electric current through the button (and
therefore the circuit) by not pressing the button and then
restore the flow of electric current through the button (and the
circuit) by pressing the button.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Congratulations!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You’ve just built the same
circuit used in
most simple flashlights…<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
In the next project, we’ll add software into the equation, and will start using "GPIOs"
to control our output.</p>
