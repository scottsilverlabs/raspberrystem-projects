      In this project, we're going to introduce an input device -- the
      pushbutton -- that will allow us to start controlling the functionality
      of our circuit.

  <p>In this project we'll be adding a new input device -- the pushbutton (or
  just "button"). A button is just a very simple switch – electric current can
  flow through it only when it is pressed.</p>

  <p>Take one of the buttons out of your <strong>I/O (Input/Output)
  RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong> so we can take a closer look at how a button
  works. This is a representation of most basic pushbuttons – they have four
  “legs” that can be attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit and
  then one button in the center of the device that can be pushed (“closed”) or
  released (“open”):</p><img style=
  "display: block; margin: auto; width: 200px;" alt="" src=
  "img/button1%20cropped.jpg">

  <p>Internally, the left side of the button (the two legs on the left) are
  connected together, and the right side of the button (the two legs on the
  right) are connected together:</p><img style="width: 402px;" alt="" src=
  "img/button2%20cropped.jpg">

  <p>When we insert a button into a circuit, it has one of two operations:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open circuit, no
      electric current can flow through the button and nothing happens.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and closes the
      circuit – electric current can then flow through the button.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>So, if we go back to our first breadboard circuit containing a simple
  resistor and LED that is always illuminated, we should be able to add a
  switch that we can then use to control the LED turning on and off (by
  pressing the button).</p>

  <p>Let’s build that circuit now…</p>

  <p>Here’s what the schematic will look like: <img class="schematic" style=
  "width:200px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-With-Button.png" alt=""></p>

  <p>To build the circuit, let's start with the circuit we built in the last
  project -- <a href="RASPBERRY_PI_POWER.html">GETTING POWER FROM THE RASPBERRY
  PI</a>:</p><img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png"
  alt="">
  <h4>Step #1: Remove wire from LED to ground.</h4>

  <p>We’re going to be adding the button into the circuit between the LED and
  ground, so the first step will be to remove the wire that connects the LED to
  ground.</p>

  <p>This is what the breadboard should look like at this point:</p><img class=
  "bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_1_bb.png" alt="">
  <h4>Step #2: Provide connectivity from the LED to the button.</h4>

  <p>The next step is to provide connectivity between the second lead of the
  LED and the button. You can wire the button directly to the LED, but to space
  the parts out a little more, we're going to first add an additional wire (one
  of the the half-inch green wires).</p>

  <p>This is what the breadboard should look like at this point:</p><img class=
  "bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_2_bb.png" alt="">
  <h4>Step #3: Place button on the breadboard.</h4>

  <p>Next, we’ll place the button on the breadboard. Note that the button
  should be oriented so that the two sides of the button sit on different
  connect strips, as follows:</p>
  <table style="margin: auto; width: 70%;">
    </div>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="img/Button_orientation_correct.png" alt=""></td>
        <td><img src="img/Button_orientation_wrong.png" alt=""></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>CORRECT</strong></td>
        <td><strong><span style="color: red;">WRONG!!!</span></strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>One side of the button should sit in the same connect strip as the green
  wire from the LED. This will provide connectivity from the LED through the
  green wire and to the button, as follows:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Introducing_Buttons_3_bb.png" alt="">

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In our diagram above, you'll notice that the button
  sits across a notch in the breadboard. This isn't absolutely necessary -- the
  button could sit with both left legs in the same connect strip and both right
  legs in the same connect strip. But, because buttons take up a lot of space
  on the breadboard, we find it easier to position them across a notch in many
  cases. You can decide how you want to wire your buttons, but keep in mind
  that either way will work.</p>
  <h4>Step #4: Connect the other side of the button to ground.</h4>

  <p>Finally, we can complete the circuit by connecting the other side of the
  button to ground, like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Introducing_Buttons_4_bb.png" alt="">

  <p>At this point, your LED should <strong>not</strong> be lit. Remember,
  while we have a <span style="font-style: italic;">potentially</span> complete
  circuit, there is still a lack of physical connection through the button
  until the button is pressed. In other words, there is a break in the circuit
  <i>inside</i> the button (this is how a button works) and the way to complete
  the circuit is to press the button.</p>

  <p>If you press the button, you should see the LED illuminate.</p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      "Breaking the Circuit"
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>In this project, we controlled the flow of electric current through
      the circuit by inserting a switch (the button) between the LED and
      ground. That said, the switch didn't need to be inserted at that point in
      the circuit for it to work -- we could have inserted the switch anywhere
      in the circuit and it would have worked the exact same way. Remember, if
      the flow of electric charge is broken anywhere in the circuit, the
      circuit will fail to operate. So, our decision to insert the button where
      we did was completely arbitrary.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Congratulations - you’ve just built the same circuit used in most simple
  flashlights!</p>

  <p>In the next project, we’ll add software into the equation, and will start
  using "GPIOs" to control our output.</p>

  <h2>Resistive Circuits, Open Circuits &amp; Short Circuits</h2>

  <p>Where we have electricity flowing from a power source (Vcc), through one
  or more components (Load) and to a point of lower voltage (many times 0V or
  Ground), we call that type of circuit a <strong>Resistive Circuit</strong>.
  Creating a resistive circuit is the first step in creating a useful piece of
  electronics.</p>

  <p>Remember our battery and lightbulb circuit above?</p><img style=
  "margin: auto; width: 600px;" src=
  "img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m184d94fb.jpg" alt="">

  <p>This is an example of a resistive circuit.</p>

  <p>Sometimes we don't have all the components of a resistive circuit, in
  which case our electronics will typically not work as expected. Two common
  examples are open circuits and short circuits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Open Circuit</strong> – An open circuit is one that is not
      complete, and therefore electric charge can’t flow. As mentioned earlier,
      electric charge can't easily flow through air, so if a circuit is not
      complete, the electrical current is experiencing nearly infinite
      resistance at some point in the circuit and circuit will not
      function.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Short Circuit</strong> – A short circuit is what happens when
      the beginning of the circuit (Vcc) is attached to the end of the circuit
      (Ground) with nothing (no Load) in between. Electricity can flow through
      wire with almost no resistance, so attaching a wire from power to ground
      with nothing in between will cause large amounts of electricity to flow
      through that wire. This can dissipate your power source very quickly, or
      worst-case, the large flow of current can heat up the wire to the point
      where it breaks or causes a fire.</p>

  </ul>
