<h1>INTRODUCING BUTTONS</h1>
<p>It’s now time to add a new component to our circuit – a
pushbutton (or just “button”).&nbsp; A button is just a very
simple switch – when it’s not pressed, electric current can't
flow through the button
and when it is pressed, electric current does flow through the button.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at how a button works.&nbsp; This
is a
representation of most basic pushbuttons – they have four “legs”
that can be attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit and
then one button in the center of the device that can be un-pushed
(“open”) or pushed (“closed”):</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Internally, the left side of the
button (the two legs on the
left) are connected together, and the right side of the button (the two
legs on
the right) are connected together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The
left side and the right side are separated by a switch that opens and
closes as
the button is pressed or unpressed:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style=""><img style="height: 637px; width: 402px;" alt="" src="img/button2%20cropped.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_243"></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When we insert a button into a circuit, it has one of two
operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open
circuit, no electric current can flow through the button and nothing
happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and
closes the circuit – electric current can then flow through the button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, if we go back to our first
breadboard circuit containing
a simple resistor and LED that is always illuminated, we should be able
to add
a switch that we can then use to control the LED turning on and off (by
pressing the button).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let’s build that circuit now…<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here’s what the schematic will look
like:<o:p></o:p></p>
<img class="schematic" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-With-Button.png" width="200">  
<p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal">To build the circuit, we can start
with the circuit we built
in 
	<a href="RASPBERRY_PI_POWER.html">Raspberry Pi Power</a>:</p>

<img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<h2>Step #1:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remove
wire from LED to ground.<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">We’re going to be adding the button
into the circuit between
the LED and ground, so the first step will be to remove the wire that
connects
the LED to ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is what the breadboard should
look like at this point:<o:p></o:p></p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_1_bb.png">
<h2>Step #2:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Place
button on the breadboard.<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--Need to talk about placing that new green wire.  Troubleshooting box on seating the button correctly.  Diagram the right and wrong way to place the button?-->Next, we’ll place the button on the
breadboard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note
that the button should be oriented so
that the two sides of the button sit on different connect strips.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is what the breadboard should
look like at this point:<o:p></o:p></p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_2_bb.png">
<h2><span style="">Step #3:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Connect the LED to one side of the button.<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Now, we
connect the
side of the LED that was previously connected to ground to one side of
the
button.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t
matter which side of
the button we connect to, so we’ll just connect to the side that is
closest to
the LED, like so: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_3_bb.png">
<h2><span style="">Step #4:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Connect the other side of the button to ground.<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Finally,
we can
complete the circuit by connecting the other side of the button to
ground, like
this: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_4_bb.png">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">At this
point, your
LED should not be lit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remember,
while
we have a&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">potentially</span>
complete circuit, there is still a lack of physical
connection through the button until the button is pressed.<span style="">&nbsp;
In other words, there is a break in the circuit inside the button (this
is how a button works) and the way to complete the circuit is to press
the button.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style=""></span>If you press the button,
you should see the
LED illuminate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span></p>
<div class="info">
<div>"Breaking the Circuit"</div>
<div>
In this project, we controlled the flow of electric current
through the circuit by inserting a switch (the button) between the LED
and ground.
That said, the switch didn't need to be inserted at that point in the
circuit for it to work -- we could have inserted the switch anywhere in
the circuit
and it would have worked the exact same way. Remember, if the flow of
electric charge is broken anywhere
in the circuit, the circuit will fail to
operate. So, our decision to insert the button where we did was
completely arbitrary. </div></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">In this
project,
we’ve manipulated the circuit using a purely physical device.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By inserting the button
into the circuit, we
can interrupt the flow of electric current through the button (and
therefore the circuit) by not pressing the button and then
restore the flow of electric current through the button (and the
circuit) by pressing the button.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Congratulations!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You’ve just built the same
circuit used in
most simple flashlights…<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="">In the next
project, we’ll add software into the equation using GPIOs.</span></p>
