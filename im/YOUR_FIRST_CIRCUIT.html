<h1>YOUR FIRST CIRCUIT</h1>
<p>In this project,
you’re going to create your first electric circuit.  But, before we
do that, some introductory discussion would probably be helpful. 
Let’s talk about some of the basic of electricity, circuits and how
they work.</p><br><h2>Your First Circuit</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve
spent a good bit of time talking about electricity and circuits,
let’s jump into a real-life example of building a circuit.  We’ve
provided all parts you will need to build this circuit as part of the
RaspberrySTEM kit, so follow along!</p>
<p>The purpose of this
circuit to power and illuminate a “light emitting diode (or “LED”
for short).  An LED a light source that looks and works a bit like a
lightbulb, so this circuit will work nearly identically to the
circuit pictured above with the battery and the lightbulb. 
</p>
<p>To build this
circuit, you’ll need the following components (all provided in the bag marked "Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM Cell"):</p><p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 466px; height: 392px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_parts_bb.png"><br></p>
<br><ol>
	<li><p>
	3 Volt Battery 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>
	100 Ohm Resistor 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>
	Red LED 
	</p>
	</li></ol>
<p>By the way, remember
how we mentioned earlier that sometimes we want to provide extra
resistance to a circuit to get it to work?  Notice that we have
included a resistor in this circuit – its job is to reduce the
amount of electricity (current) flowing through the circuit so that
the LED doesn’t burn out.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s give
this a try, step by step…</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1: 
&nbsp;Connect the Resistor and LED to the Battery</p><p>Using
your fingers, pinch one lead of the resistor (a "lead" is the metal
wire on one side) to the positive (+) side of the battery and pinch the
shorter lead of the LED (one of the leads is longer than the other) to
the negative (-) side of the battery. &nbsp;</p><p>Like this:&nbsp; </p><p></p>

<p><br><br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2: Touch the Other Leads of the Resistor and LED Together</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Using your free hand, touch the other leads of the resistor and LED together, as indicated below:</span></p><p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 767px; height: 222px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_complete_bb.png"><br></p>
<p><br><br>
</p><p>At this point, the
LED should be lit, like this:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_130350ad.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="518" width="474"></p>
<p><br>Congratulations...you just built your first electric circuit!</p><p></p>
