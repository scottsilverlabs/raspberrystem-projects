      In this project, you're going to create your first electric circuit using
      a few basic components that we've provided in the kit.

  <p>Before we get started, notice that we've added some information in a blue
  header at the top of this project. This header includes some important
  information that you will likely want to review before continuing on,
  including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Project Name &amp; Description:</strong> This is a brief
      overview of the project you're about to start.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Hardware Required:</strong> This will tell you which cells (or
      other hardware) are going to be used in the project.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>New Concepts Required:</strong> These are the tutorials we
      suggest you read before getting started on the project. These tutorials
      will provide background information that will make the project much
      easier to understand and complete.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>From here on, we'll include this type of header in every project so that
  you'll know what to expect -- and what is needed -- for the upcoming project.
  In some cases, the header will also indicate what your hardware setup should
  look like coming into the project -- this is especially true when a project
  is a continuation of a previous project.</p>

      What is Electronics?
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>Electronics is the study and building of circuits that rely on various
      types of components, including wires, computer chips and other common
      electrical devices. Through the study of programming and electronics, you
      can learn where these two areas collide, often referred to as "embedded
      systems" or "consumer devices." By combining programming and electronics,
      we can design and build games, tools and devices that can solve real
      world problems, as well as provide entertainment and ultimately make life
      easier and more convenient.</p>

  <h2>Your First Circuit</h2>

  <p>Now that you've (hopefully) spent some time reading our <a href=
  "INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS</a>, let’s jump into
  a real-life example of building a circuit.</p>

  <p>We’ve provided all parts you will need to build this circuit as part of
  the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, in the bag marked <strong>Your First Circuit
  RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong>. You'll find this bag (along with all the other
  project parts you'll need later) in the box marked <strong>OPEN LATER --
  Project Parts</strong>. Open the box/bag and follow along!</p>

  <p>The purpose of this circuit is to power and illuminate a “light emitting
  diode" (or “LED” for short). An LED a light source that looks and works a bit
  like a lightbulb (in that they both light up when you run electric current
  through them), so this circuit will work nearly identically to the circuit
  discussed in <a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">INTRODUCTION TO
  ELECTRONICS</a> with the battery and the lightbulb.</p>

  <p>To build this circuit, you’ll need the following three components (all
  provided in the bag marked <strong>Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM
  Cell</strong>):</p>
  <table style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><img style=
        "width: 200px; height: auto;" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_battery.png"
        alt=""></td>
        <td style=
        "vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; font-size: 140%;">
        <strong>BATTERY</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: auto; height: auto;"
        src="img/Your_First_Circuit_LED.png" alt=""></td>
        <td style=
        "vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; font-size: 140%;">
        <strong>LED</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><img src=
        "img/Your_First_Circuit_resistor.png" alt=""></td>
        <td style=
        "vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; font-size: 140%;">
        <strong>RESISTOR</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>By the way, remember how we mentioned in <a href=
  "INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS</a> that sometimes we
  want to provide extra resistance to a circuit to get it to work? Notice that
  we have included a resistor in this circuit – its job is to reduce the amount
  of electric current flowing through the circuit so that the LED doesn’t
  break.</p>

  <p>Okay, let’s give this a try, step by step…</p>
  <h4>Step #1: Connect the Resistor and LED to the Battery</h4>

  <p>Using your fingers, pinch one lead of the resistor (the "leads" are the
  metal wires on either side) to the positive (+) side of the battery and pinch
  the shorter lead of the LED (one of the leads is longer than the other) to
  the other side of the battery (we refer to this as the "negative" side).</p>

  <p>Like this:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Circuit_connect_battery_bb.png" alt=""></p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      Wiring LEDs
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>An important concept to understand about LEDs is that they are
      "unidirectional" -- in other words, they only allow electric current to
      flow in one direction. If you hook up the LED backwards -- in the way
      that electric current won't be allowed to flow through it -- it will not
      illuminate and the rest of the circuit will stop working as well
      (remember, if electric current isn't flowing at any point in the circuit,
      it's not going to be flowing anywhere in the circuit).</p>

      <p>There are three ways to determine the correct way to orient the
      LED:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>

          <p>Look at the leads (the metal legs on either side of the LED). One
          is going to be a bit longer than the other. For the LED to work
          correctly, the longer lead should be closest to the power source and
          the shorter lead should be closest to ground.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>There is a raised ridge that runs around the base of the LED bulb.
          That ridge is flattened on one side of the bulb. The side of the bulb
          where the ridge is flattened should be facing closer to the ground
          than to power in the circuit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Just hook it up one way and hope you get lucky! If that doesn't
          work, reverse it. Keep in mind that if there are other issues with
          your circuit, it's possible that the LED won't illuminate in either
          case, and you still won't know if the LED is oriented correctly. If
          that happens, we suggest reverting back to #1 or #2 to ensure the LED
          is oriented correctly so you can rule that out as a possible problem
          in your circuit.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h4>Step #2: Touch the Other Leads of the Resistor and LED Together</h4>

  <p>Using your free hand, touch the other leads of the resistor and LED
  together, as indicated below:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Circuit_complete_bb.png" alt="">

  <p>At this point, the LED should be lit, like this:</p><img src=
  "img/LED%20finger%20circuit.jpg" width="80%" alt="">

  <p>Congratulations...you just built your first electric circuit!</p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      Why the Resistor?
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>You'll notice that if you remove the resistor from the circuit above
      and attach the LED directly to the battery, the LED still lights. Which
      means you're probably wondering why we need the resistor at all?</p>

      <p>Often, electronic components can only handle certain maximum voltages
      and/or currents. In general, the manufacturer of the component does a
      bunch of testing to determine how much voltage and/or current the part
      can handle before it's at risk of being damaged or working improperly.
      When a power supply puts out more voltage/current than the part can
      handle, a resistor in the circuit can reduce the voltage/current to
      ensure the part isn't damaged and works properly.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      Shorting Wires
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>Sometimes your circuit won't work and you just can't figure out what
      the problem is. When this happens, it's a good idea to verify that wires
      and components aren't touching each other in places where you don't
      intend them to ("a short circuit"). Electric current flowing through a
      circuit is going to look for the easiest way to get to the lowest point
      of voltage (usually ground), and sometimes -- if wires or components are
      touching where you don't expect them to -- you may be inadvertently
      creating a new path for electric current to flow and that electric
      current may be traveling in ways that bypass your components and give you
      unexpected results.</p>
