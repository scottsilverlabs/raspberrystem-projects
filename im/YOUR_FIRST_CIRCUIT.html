<p>In this project,
you’re going to create your first electric circuit. But, before we
do that, some introductory discussion would probably be helpful.
&nbsp;We highly recommend reading the following: &nbsp;<a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTONICS.html">Introduction to Electronics</a>.
&nbsp;Note that in future projects we will be calling out
introductory
material in the "New Concepts Required" section at the top of the
projects. &nbsp;We recommend that before jumping into a project,
you
ensure that you've read and familiarized yourself with any of the
concepts listed in that section.</p>
<br>
<h2>Your First Circuit</h2>
<p>Now that you've (hopefully) spent some time reading our
introduction to electricity and circuits,
let’s jump into a real-life example of building a circuit. We’ve
provided all parts you will need to build this circuit as part of the
RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup> kit, in the bag marked <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM</span><sup style="font-weight: bold;">TM</sup><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Cell</span>.
&nbsp;Open the bag and follow along!</p>
<p>The purpose of this
circuit is to power and illuminate a “light emitting diode" (or “LED”
for short). An LED a light source that looks and works a bit like a
lightbulb (in that they both light up when you run electric current
through them), so this circuit will work nearly identically to the
circuit discussed in&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Introduction
to Electronics</span> with the battery and the lightbulb. </p>
<p>To build this
circuit, you’ll need the following three components (all provided in
the bag marked&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Your
First Circuit RaspberrySTEM Cell</span>):</p>

<p>By the way, remember
how we mentioned in <a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTONICS.html">Introduction
to Electronics</a> that sometimes we want to provide extra
resistance to a circuit to get it to work? Notice that we have
included a resistor in this circuit – its job is to reduce the
amount of electric current flowing through the circuit so that
the LED doesn’t break.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s give
this a try, step by step…</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Step #1: &nbsp;Connect the Resistor and LED to the Battery</h2>
<p>Using
your fingers, pinch one lead of the resistor (the "leads" are the metal
wires on either side) to the positive (+) side of the battery and pinch
the
shorter lead of the LED (one of the leads is longer than the other) to
the other side of the battery (we refer to this as the "negative"
side). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like this:&nbsp; </p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 764px; height: 222px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_connect_battery_bb.png"><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<div class="info">
<div>Wiring LEDs</div>
<div>
<p>An important concept to understand about LEDs is that they are
"unidirectional" -- in other words, they only allow electric current to
flow in one direction. &nbsp;If you hook up the LED backwards -- in
the way that electric current won't be allowed to flow through it -- it
will not illuminate and the rest of the circuit will stop working as
well (remember, if electric current isn't flowing at any point in the
circuit, it's not going to be flowing anywhere in the circuit).
</p>
<p>To determine the correct way to orient the LED, you can look
at it's leads (the metal legs on either side of the LED). &nbsp;One
is going to be a bit longer than the other. &nbsp;In order for the
LED to work correctly, the longer lead should be closest to the power
source and the shorter lead should be closer to ground. &nbsp;If
you find that you believe an LED circuit should be working, but it's
not, you might want to verify that the LED is oriented correctly.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>By the way, even experienced electronics engineers will
sometimes
make this mistake, so don't feel bad if you find that you're constantly
wiring LED backwards!

<h2>Step #2: Touch the Other Leads of the Resistor and LED
Together</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Using your free hand, touch the
other leads of the resistor and LED together, as indicated below:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 767px; height: 222px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_complete_bb.png"><br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>At this point, the
LED should be lit, like this:</p>
<p></p>

<p><br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Congratulations...you just built your first electric circuit!</p>
<div class="info">
<div>Shorting Wires</div>
<div><p>
Sometimes your circuit won't work and you just can't figure out what
the problem is. When this happens, it's a good idea to verify that
wires and components aren't touching each other in places where you
don't intend them to. Electric current flowing through a circuit is
going to look for the easiest way to get to the lowest point of voltage
(usually ground), and sometimes -- if wires or components are touching
where you don't expect them to -- you may be inadvertently
creating a new path for electric current to flow and that electric
current may be traveling in ways that bypass your components and give
you unexpected results.
