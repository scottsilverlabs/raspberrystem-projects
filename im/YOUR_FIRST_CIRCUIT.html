<h1>YOUR FIRST CIRCUIT</h1>
<p>In this project,
you’re going to create your first electric circuit. But, before we
do that, some introductory discussion would probably be helpful.
We highly recommend reading the following: <a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">Introduction to Electronics</a>.
Note that in future projects we will be calling out
introductory
material in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">New
Concepts Required</span> section at the top of the
projects (see above). We recommend that before jumping into a
project,
you
ensure that you've read and familiarized yourself with any of the
concepts listed in that section, as they will likely be helpful for
that project.</p>
<div class="info">
<div>What is Electronics?</div>
<div>
<p>Electronics is the study and building of circuits that
rely on various
types of components, including wires, computer chips and other common
electrical devices. Through the study of programming and electronics,
you can learn where these two areas collide, often referred to as
"embedded systems" or "consumer devices." By combining programming and
electronics, we can design and build games, tools and devices that can
solve real world problems, as well as provide entertainment and
ultimately make life easier and more convenient. </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At
the top of each projects, we'll also be listing the hardware required
for the project and, if the project is a continuation of a previous
project, what the hardware setup should look like before you jump in. </p>
<h2>Your First Circuit</h2>
<p>Now that you've (hopefully) spent some time reading our
introduction to electricity and circuits,
let’s jump into a real-life example of building a circuit. We’ve
provided all parts you will need to build this circuit as part of the
RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, in the bag marked <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM Cell</span>.
You'll find this bag (along with all the other project parts) in the box marked <span style="font-weight: bold;">OPEN LATER -- Project Parts</span>. Open the box/bag and follow along!</p>
<p>The purpose of this
circuit is to power and illuminate a “light emitting diode" (or “LED”
for short). An LED a light source that looks and works a bit like a
lightbulb (in that they both light up when you run electric current
through them), so this circuit will work nearly identically to the
circuit discussed in <a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">Introduction
to Electronics</a> with the battery and the lightbulb. </p>
<p>To build this
circuit, you’ll need the following three components (all provided in
the bag marked <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your
First Circuit RaspberrySTEM Cell</span>):</p>

<p></p>
<p>By the way, remember
how we mentioned in <a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">Introduction
to Electronics</a> that sometimes we want to provide extra
resistance to a circuit to get it to work? Notice that we have
included a resistor in this circuit – its job is to reduce the
amount of electric current flowing through the circuit so that
the LED doesn’t break.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s give
this a try, step by step…</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1:  Connect
the Resistor and LED to the Battery</p>
<p>Using
your fingers, pinch one lead of the resistor (the "leads" are the metal
wires on either side) to the positive (+) side of the battery and pinch
the
shorter lead of the LED (one of the leads is longer than the other) to
the other side of the battery (we refer to this as the "negative"
side).  </p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_connect_battery_bb.png">
</p>

<div class="info">
<div>Wiring LEDs</div>
<div>
<p>An important concept to understand about LEDs is that they are
"unidirectional" -- in other words, they only allow electric current to
flow in one direction.  If you hook up the LED backwards -- in
the way that electric current won't be allowed to flow through it -- it
will not illuminate and the rest of the circuit will stop working as
well (remember, if electric current isn't flowing at any point in the
circuit, it's not going to be flowing anywhere in the circuit).
</p>
<p>There are three ways to determine the correct way to orient
the LED:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Look at the leads (the metal legs on either side of the
LED). One
is going to be a bit longer than the other. For the
LED to work correctly, the longer lead should be closest to the power
source and the shorter lead should be closest to ground.</p>
</li><li>
<p>There is a raised ridge that runs around the base of the LED bulb. That ridge is flattened
on one side of the bulb. The side of the bulb where the ridge is flattened should be facing closer to the
ground than to power in the circuit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just hook it up one way and hope you get lucky! If that doesn't work,
reverse it. While a lot of engineers actually use this method, keep in mind that if there
are other issues with your circuit, it's possible that the LED won't illuminate in either
case, and you still won't know if the LED is oriented correctly. If that happens, we suggest
reverting back to #1 or #2 to ensure the LED is oriented correctly so you can rule that out
as a possible problem in your circuit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, even experienced electronics engineers will
sometimes
make this mistake, so don't feel bad if you find that you're constantly
wiring LEDs backwards!

<p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2: Touch the Other
Leads of the Resistor and LED
Together<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Using your free hand, touch the
other leads of the resistor and LED together, as indicated below:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_complete_bb.png"><br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>At this point, the
LED should be lit, like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/LED%20finger%20circuit.jpg" width="80%"></p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Congratulations...you just
built your first electric circuit!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<br>
<div class="info">
<div>Why the Resistor?</div>
<div>
<p>You'll notice that if you remove the resistor from the circuit
above and attach the LED directly to the battery, the LED still lights.
Which means you're probably wondering why we need the resistor at all?
</p>
<p>Often, electronic components can only handle certain maximum voltages
and/or currents. In general, the manufacturer of the component does
a bunch of testing
to determine how much voltage and/or current the part can handle before
it's at risk of being damaged or working improperly. When a power
supply puts out
more voltage/current than the part can handle, 
a resistor in the circuit can reduce the voltage/current to
ensure the
part isn't damaged and works properly.

<div class="info">
<div><b><b><b>Shorting Wires</b></b></b></div>
<div>
<p>Sometimes your circuit won't work
and you just can't figure
out what
the problem is. When this happens, it's a good idea to verify that
wires and components aren't touching each other in places where you
don't intend them to. Electric current flowing through a circuit is
going to look for the easiest way to get to the lowest point of voltage
(usually ground), and sometimes -- if wires or components are touching
where you don't expect them to -- you may be inadvertently
creating a new path for electric current to flow and that electric
current may be traveling in ways that bypass your components and give
you unexpected results.
