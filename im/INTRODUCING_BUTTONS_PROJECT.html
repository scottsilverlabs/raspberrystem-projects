<div class=section id=intro>
  <p>In this project we'll be adding a new input device -- the pushbutton (or
  just "button"). A button is just a very simple switch – electric current can
  flow through it only when it is pressed.</p>

  <p>So, if we go back to our first breadboard circuit containing a simple
  resistor and LED that is always illuminated, we should be able to add a
  switch that we can then use to control the LED turning on and off (by
  pressing the button).</p>

  <p>Let’s build that circuit now…</p>

  <p>Here’s what the schematic will look like: <img class="schematic" style=
  "width:200px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-With-Button.png" alt=""></p>

</div>
<div class=section id=hw>

  <p>To build the circuit, let's start with the circuit we built in the last
  project -- <a data-uid="rpipower"></a>:</p><img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png"
  alt="">
  <h3 class=step>Remove wire from LED to ground.</h3>

  <p>We’re going to be adding the button into the circuit between the LED and
  ground, so the first step will be to remove the wire that connects the LED to
  ground.</p>

  <p>This is what the breadboard should look like at this point:</p><img class=
  "bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_1_bb.png" alt="">
  <h3 class=step>Provide connectivity from the LED to the button.</h3>

  <p>The next step is to provide connectivity between the second lead of the
  LED and the button. You can wire the button directly to the LED, but to space
  the parts out a little more, we're going to first add an additional wire (one
  of the the half-inch green wires).</p>

  <p>This is what the breadboard should look like at this point:</p><img class=
  "bb" src="img/Introducing_Buttons_2_bb.png" alt="">
  <h3 class=step>Place button on the breadboard.</h3>

  <p>Next, we’ll place the button on the breadboard. Note that the button
  should be oriented so that the two sides of the button sit on different
  connect strips, as follows:</p>
  <table style="margin: auto; width: 70%;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="img/Button_orientation_correct.png" alt=""></td>
        <td><img src="img/Button_orientation_wrong.png" alt=""></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>CORRECT</strong></td>
        <td><strong><span style="color: red;">WRONG!!!</span></strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>One side of the button should sit in the same connect strip as the green
  wire from the LED. This will provide connectivity from the LED through the
  green wire and to the button, as follows:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Introducing_Buttons_3_bb.png" alt="">

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In our diagram above, you'll notice that the button
  sits across a notch in the breadboard. This isn't absolutely necessary -- the
  button could sit with both left legs in the same connect strip and both right
  legs in the same connect strip. But, because buttons take up a lot of space
  on the breadboard, we find it easier to position them across a notch in many
  cases. You can decide how you want to wire your buttons, but keep in mind
  that either way will work.</p>
  <h3 class=step>Connect the other side of the button to ground.</h3>

  <p>Finally, we can complete the circuit by connecting the other side of the
  button to ground, like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Introducing_Buttons_4_bb.png" alt="">

  <p>At this point, your LED should <strong>not</strong> be lit. Remember,
  while we have a <span style="font-style: italic;">potentially</span> complete
  circuit, there is still a lack of physical connection through the button
  until the button is pressed. In other words, there is a break in the circuit
  <i>inside</i> the button (this is how a button works) and the way to complete
  the circuit is to press the button.</p>

  <p>If you press the button, you should see the LED illuminate.</p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      "Breaking the Circuit"
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>In this project, we controlled the flow of electric current through
      the circuit by inserting a switch (the button) between the LED and
      ground. That said, the switch didn't need to be inserted at that point in
      the circuit for it to work -- we could have inserted the switch anywhere
      in the circuit and it would have worked the exact same way. Remember, if
      the flow of electric charge is broken anywhere in the circuit, then we've
      created an <i>open circuit</i>, and current will not flow.
      So, our decision to insert the button where
      we did was completely arbitrary.</p>

  <p>Congratulations - you’ve just built the same circuit used in most simple
  flashlights!</p>

<div class=section id=challenge>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>We added the button in at the end of our circuit (after the LED and resistor).  What
      happens if you add it before the LED and resistor?  Why or why not?
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Similarly, can you add the resistor into our circuit in between the
      LED and resistor?  Why or why not?
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We used two additional short green wires to hook up the button.  Can
      you hook it up without any additional green wires?
    </li>
