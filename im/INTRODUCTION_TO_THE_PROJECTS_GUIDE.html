<h1>INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECTS GUIDE</h1>
<p>Welcome to the
RaspberrySTEM Projects Guide!  
</p>
<p>This guide is
available both as part of your RaspberrySTEM IDE and on our website
at:<!--Do we want this on the website?  Discuss.  At least if we don't put a link to it here, we can decide later.
--></p>
<p><span lang="en-US"><u><a href="http://www.raspberrystem.com/guide">http://www.raspberrystem.com/guide</a></u></span></p>
<p>The goal of the
RaspberrySTEM is to provide a step-by-step roadmap to learning the
key principles of programming and electronics, and this guide is that
roadmap.  Before we get started, here are a few notes and thoughts on
how to make the best use this guide and the RaspberrySTEM kit:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>While you’re welcome to skip
	around this guide as you please, if you have no previous experience
	with programming or electronics, we recommend that you read and
	follow the projects in this guide in the order in which they’re
	presented.  The guide is designed to build on itself, and skipping
	sections may make it difficult to fully understand later concepts
	and projects in the guide.</p>
	</li><li><p>This guide is broken up into
	sections – some sections are labeled, “Concepts” and some are
	labeled “Projects.”  The concepts are the important principles
	to learn prior to doing the Projects, and we have attempted to
	include the Concepts …<!--We're now using "Concept Blocks" (exact name TBD) within "Projects".--></p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
	<li><p>Throughout the guide, we
	provide links to other resources that can be used to round out your
	understanding of the concepts being presented.</p>
	</li><li><p>…<!--At minimum, lets clean up this section so it looks complete, even if we don't add any more content (remove ellipses)--></p>
</li></ul>
