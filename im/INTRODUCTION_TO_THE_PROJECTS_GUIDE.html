<h1>INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECTS GUIDE</h1>
<p>Welcome to the
RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup> Projects Guide!  
</p>
<p>This guide is
available both as part of your RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup> IDE and on our website
at:</p>
<p><span lang="en-US"><u><a href="http://www.raspberrystem.com/guide">http://www.raspberrystem.com/guide</a></u></span></p>
<p>The goal of the
RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup> is to provide a
step-by-step roadmap to learning the
key principles of programming and electronics, and this guide is that
roadmap. &nbsp;You're probably ready to just jump right in (and we're
ready too!), but before we get started, we wanted to offer a few notes
and thoughts on
how to make the best use this guide and the RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup>
kit. &nbsp;Some of these things won't make sense just yet (they will
when we jump into the projects), so if something below doesn't make
sense right now, you can skip over it now and refer back here as
necessary.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>We've made every attempt to make this Projects Guide
completely self-contained, self-explanatory and FUN! &nbsp;We realize
that learning programming and electronics can be a difficult (and
sometimes frustrating) process, and our goal with the RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup>
kit (and this guide) is to make the process as simple as possible.
&nbsp;That said, both programming and electronics are subjects where
the basics can be learned very quickly, but at the same time, you can
spend a lifetime mastering them. Everyone learns differently and at
different rates -- some people will be able to move quickly through
each project in this guide, and some will want to spread out the
learning process over weeks or months -- it's important that you work
at your own pace and do what's comfortable for you.</p></li><li><p>While
you’re welcome to skip around this guide as you please, if you have no
previous experience with programming or electronics, we recommend that
you read and follow the projects in this guide in the order in which
they’re presented. The guide is designed to build on itself, and
skipping sections may make it difficult to fully understand later
concepts and projects in the guide. &nbsp;The small projects early in
the guide eventually build into larger -- and MORE FUN -- projects
later in the guide.</p></li><li><p>Within
the projects, and especially towards the beginning where there is a lot
of important introductory information, we will have included sections
called "???." &nbsp;These are sections of additional information that,
while not absolutely necessary to understand and complete the projects,
will contain good information to help you better understand the basics
of programming, electronics and how to use the RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup> kit. &nbsp;This is what an ??? section looks like...and this example also contains some information you should read:<br><br>[Add info div here on definition of programming and electronics]</p></li><li><p>Because
a large portion of this guide will be used to teach programming, we
wanted to provide some conventions on how we would demonstrate the code
you would be writing. &nbsp;Because code can be very finicky -- you
have to space things the right way, capitalize things correctly, etc.
-- it's important for you to know exactly what the code should look
like. &nbsp;For that reason, we have put all the code snippets (a cute
term for several lines of code) in their own special boxes. &nbsp;They
will look like this:<br><br>[Add code box (no line numbers) example here]</p></li><li><p>In
some code boxes, you'll see line numbers included to the left of the
code. &nbsp;We'll discuss this more later, but in the window where
you'll be typing in your code, line numbers will automatically be
included. &nbsp;When we put line numbers along with the code, this is
simply for you to use as a reference to ensure that you can more easily
type in your code correctly. &nbsp;It's also a good way for us to
discuss the code -- we just need to mention the line number(s) and
you'll know what code we're talking about. &nbsp;Here's an example of
what a code box with line numbers might look like:<br><br>[Add code box (with line numbers) example here]&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
There will be many instances where we will provide a snippet of code in
a project, and you'll want to type in exactly as we displayed it.
&nbsp;But, this might require a lot of typing or you may want to ensure
that you don't type things incorrectly. &nbsp;For that reason, we
provide the ability for you to "cut-and-paste" code right from this
project guide into the window where you'll be writing your code.
&nbsp;We'll provide an example of how to do this in Project #1, but we
wanted to mention it so you can look for the instructions.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li><p>With some programs you write, there will be
"output" from your code. &nbsp;Output is just a fancy word for
information that your code spits back out at you, either because you
told it to or because there was a problem with your code that the
computer wanted to let you know about. &nbsp;There is a place in our
development window where output will be displayed, and in some
projects, we'll want to let you know upfront what output you should
expect. &nbsp;When we want to show you what output to expect, we'll
provide an output box that might look a little something like this:<br><br>[Add output box example here]&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Just
like with the programming side of things, for the electronics, we'll be
providing a couple different ways to demonstrate exactly how you build
the projects on your RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup> kit. &nbsp;We'll
introduce these conventions in the first few projects, but we wanted to
say upfront that every step of the building process will be provided
and hopefully you'll have no problem following along with the guide. <br></p>
	</li></ul>

<p>Now that we've sufficiently bored you with this introduction, it's
time to jump into the hands-on stuff! &nbsp;The next topic we'll
discuss is this how to use this development environment, and after
that, we'll jump right into the projects...<br><br>
