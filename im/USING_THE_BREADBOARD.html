<h1>USING THE BREADBOARD</h1>

<p>In the previous
sections, we talked about circuits, how they work, how we build them
and how we represent them on a schematic diagram. We even built our
first circuit using a battery, a resistor, and LED and some wires. </p>

<p>When it comes to
building circuits in real life, connecting wires and components
together like we did above – either twisting the wires together or
soldering them together – is certainly one way to do it. While
sometimes it makes sense to build circuits by twisting wires together
or soldering, the problem is that these modifying these types of
circuits can be very difficult and cumbersome.</p>

<p>In most cases,
you’ll want to build temporary circuits that are easy to modify –
this lets you “play around” with the circuit and work out the
kinks in your design; then, once you have a temporary circuit that is
working exactly the way you want, you can use the design as the basis
for your permanent circuit.</p>

<p>One of the most
common ways of building a temporary circuit involves the use of a
“breadboard,” which you may also hear referred to as a
“proto-board.” The name breadboard stems from the fact that
early electronics hobbyists would often use the large wooden boards
designed for rolling out and cutting bread dough to house their
temporary circuits.</p>

<p>The breadboards used
to build electronics are often called “solderless” breadboards,
which can help avoid confusion when talking to your pastry chef
friends. <big><big>☺</big></big><br>

<h2>Breadboard Design</h2>

<p>Breadboards come in
many shapes and sizes, but the fundamental components of the
breadboard will remain the same:</p>

<p>We’ll get to the
purpose of each of these parts in a moment, but the key to a
breadboard’s usefulness is how the various areas are electrically
connected. Those connections are illustrated here:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_17c6d178.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="269" width="486"></p>

<p>As you can see, each
of the two rails consists of two long row of connections (a red row
in each rail and a blue row in each rail). There are spaces between
the groups of holes in the rail, but the entire row is still
electrically connected as indicated. Also note that the two red rows
are not connected and the two blue rows are not connected – they
are denoted in the same color only because they serve the same
purpose. </p>

<p>In the center of the
board, each row of five connect strips are electrically connected
together. While I only highlighted a few rows of connect strips, in
actuality, every row of five is a connected strip. It’s important
to note that there is no electrical connection across the notch –
there’s good reason for this which we’ll get to in a bit.</p>

<p>If you recall from <a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">Introduction to Electronics</a>, in order to have a closed
circuit, electricity must be able to flow from power, through the
circuit, to ground. A breadboard makes it easy to wire a circuit in
this fashion – the rails contain the start of the circuit (power)
and the end of the circuit (ground), while the connect strips provide
space for your components and the connections between those
components.</p><h2>Powering the Breadboard</h2>

<p>Of course, the circuits you build on your breadboard are going to
require power to operate. &nbsp;When it comes to providing power to the
breadboard (and to the circuits on them), there are lots of options.
&nbsp;</p><p>In our first breadboarding project, we will be using our
little 3V lithium battery to power our circuit. &nbsp;After that, we
will start using power that is supply directly through the
RaspberrySTEM kit. &nbsp;In addition, if you ever use a breadboard
outside of the RaspberrySTEM kit, you'll find that there are power
supplies built specifically for breadboards. And you always have the
option of finding your own power source (battery, solar cell, AC power
adapter, etc) and hooking that up to your breadboard as well.</p><p>We'll
go into step-by-step detail on how to hook up power to your circuits
using in our upcoming projects, but just be aware that there are lots
of options for power sources for your circuits when using a breadboard.</p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span>
