<h1>USING THE BREADBOARD</h1>

<p>In the previous
sections, we talked about circuits, how they work, how we build them
and how we represent them on a schematic diagram. We even built our
first circuit using a battery, a resistor, and LED and some wires. </p>

<p>When it comes to
building circuits in real life, connecting wires and components
together like we did above – either twisting the wires together or
soldering them together – is certainly one way to do it. While
sometimes it makes sense to build circuits by twisting wires together
or soldering, the problem is that these modifying these types of
circuits can be very difficult and cumbersome.</p>

<p>In most cases,
you’ll want to build temporary circuits that are easy to modify –
this lets you “play around” with the circuit and work out the
kinks in your design; then, once you have a temporary circuit that is
working exactly the way you want, you can use the design as the basis
for your permanent circuit.</p>

<p>One of the most
common ways of building a temporary circuit involves the use of a
“breadboard,” which you may also hear referred to as a
“proto-board.” The name breadboard stems from the fact that
early electronics hobbyists would often use the large wooden boards
designed for rolling out and cutting bread dough to house their
temporary circuits.</p>

<p>The breadboards used
to build electronics are often called “solderless” breadboards,
which can help avoid confusion when talking to your pastry chef
friends. <big><big>☺</big></big><br>
</p>

<h2>Breadboard Design</h2>

<p>Breadboards come in
many shapes and sizes, but the fundamental components of the
breadboard will remain the same:</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m2bb8db12.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="271" width="487"></p>

<p>We’ll get to the
purpose of each of these parts in a moment, but the key to a
breadboard’s usefulness is how the various areas are electrically
connected. Those connections are illustrated here:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_17c6d178.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="269" width="486"></p>

<p>As you can see, each
of the two rails consists of two long row of connections (a red row
in each rail and a blue row in each rail). There are spaces between
the groups of holes in the rail, but the entire row is still
electrically connected as indicated. Also note that the two red rows
are not connected and the two blue rows are not connected – they
are denoted in the same color only because they serve the same
purpose. </p>

<p>In the center of the
board, each row of five connect strips are electrically connected
together. While I only highlighted a few rows of connect strips, in
actuality, every row of five is a connected strip. It’s important
to note that there is no electrical connection across the notch –
there’s good reason for this which we’ll get to in a bit.</p>

<p>If you recall from
our previous on basic electrical circuits, in order to have a closed
circuit, electricity must be able to flow from power, through the
circuit, to ground. A breadboard makes it easy to wire a circuit in
this fashion – the rails contain the start of the circuit (power)
and the end of the circuit (ground), while the connect strips provide
space for your components and the connections between those
components.</p>

<h2>
Your First Circuit on the Breadboard<!--Rediagram and reqord this section to remove the wires so that it is equivalent to the previous section with a battery.  In addition, replace battery with a coin cell.--></h2>

<p>In a previous
project (Project #2), we built the following circuit using a battery,
an LED, a resistor, and some wires:</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 767px; height: 222px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_complete_bb.png"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lighting an LED Diagram</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
</p>


<p>We’re now going to
build that same circuit again, but this time using the breadboard on
our RaspberrySTEM. Note that all future projects will use the
breadboard as well…</p>

<p>
Let’s look back at our example schematic from our first circuit:</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 636px; height: 343px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit.png"><br></p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lighting an LED Schematic</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
</p>


<p>To implement that
design on our breadboard, we would follow the schematic from power (the + terminal of the battery) to
ground (the - terminal of the battery), inserting each component along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s look at this
step-by-step:<br></p>



<p><b>Step #1: &nbsp;Provide power and ground to the breadboard.</b><br></p><p>The
first step is to provide power and ground to the breadboard. To do
this, you'll need the 3V battery we used in the last project, as well
as the two bare wires and the two round adhesive dots included in the
"Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM Cell" bag.&nbsp;</p><p>....</p><p>This
is done by wiring the (+) terminal of the 3V battery to one of
the holes in the red row along the rail. This will provide power to
the entire red row, as all the holes in that row are connected.</p>

<p>
Next, wire the (-) terminal of the 3V battery to one of the holes in
the blue row along the rail. This will provide ground to the entire
blue row, as all holes in that row are connected.</p>

<p>
Here’s what the breadboard should look like at this point (with the
corresponding portion of the schematic):</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><b>Step #2: &nbsp;Bring power to one of the connect strips on the breadboard.</b></p>




<p>
Next, we will connect power from the red rail to one of the connect
strips on the breadboard (the connect strips are where we’ll be
creating the heart of the circuit). We do this by running a wire
from the power row (the red row along the rail) to any connect strip,
and firmly planting the ends of the wire into their respective holes.
Remember, it doesn’t matter which hole you choose in the power
row, as the entire row is connected. And it doesn’t matter which
connect strip you choose or which hole of the connect strip you
choose.</p>

<p>
Here’s what the breadboard should look like at this point (with the
corresponding portion of the schematic):</p>

<ol start="3">

  <li>
    <p><b>Connect the resistor.</b></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
The next step is to connect the resistor to the breadboard. We do
this by inserting one end of the resistor into the same connect strip
as the wire. We then insert the other end of the resistor into a
different connect strip. Because all five holes in the connect strip
are connected, there is now continuity all the way from the power
source (the battery) to the first connect strip, through the
resistor, and to the second connect strip.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">

  <li>
    <p><b>Provide continuity from the resistor to new connect strip.</b></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
We now place a wire from the same connect strip as the resistor to a
new connect strip. This new connect strip is where we will connect
the first lead of our LED.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
Here’s what the breadboard should look like at this point (with the
corresponding portion of the schematic):</p>

<ol start="5">

  <li>
    <p><b>Connect the LED.</b></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
Now that we have continuity from the resistor to a new connect strip,
it’s time to insert the next component – the LED. We insert one
end of the LED anywhere in the connect strip we just wired. And we
insert the other end of the LED into a new connect strip.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
<i>Note that LEDs must be oriented the correct way for electricity to
flow through them, so ensure that the long side of the LED is the
side inserted into second connect strip.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
Here’s what the breadboard should look like at this point (with the
corresponding portion of the schematic):</p>

</p>

<ol start="6">

  <li>
    <p><b>Complete the circuit.</b></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
We now have continuity all the way from power, through the resistor
and to the LED – it’s now time to complete the circuit by
attaching the LED to ground. We do this by attaching the second leg
of the LED to the blue row along the rail (the ground row). Because
the second leg of the LED is embedded in a connect strip, we can
accomplish this by connecting any part of that connect strip to any
hole in the blue row using a wire.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
Now that the circuit is completed, electricity should be flowing, and
your LED should be lit!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
Here’s what the final breadboard layout should look like:</p>
