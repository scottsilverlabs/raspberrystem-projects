<h1>USING THE BREADBOARD</h1>

<p>When it comes to
building circuits in real life, pinching and holding wires together with
your fingers as we did in the 
<a href="YOUR_FIRST_CIRCUIT.html">YOUR FIRST CIRCUIT</a> project isn't very 
practical.  </p>

<p>When building electronics in real life, we often want to first build temporary 
circuits that are easy to modify -- this lets you "play around" with the circuit 
and work out the kinks in your design; then, once you have a temporary circuit 
that is
working exactly the way you want, you can use the design as the basis
for creating a permanent circuit.</p>

<p>One of the most
common ways of building a temporary circuit involves the use of a
“breadboard.”
The name breadboard stems from the fact that
early electronics hobbyists would often use the large wooden boards
designed for rolling out and cutting bread dough to house their
temporary circuits.</p>

<p>The breadboards used
to build electronics are often called “solderless” breadboards,
which can help avoid confusion when talking to your pastry chef
friends. <big><big>☺</big></big><br>
</p>

<h2>Breadboard Design</h2>

<p>Breadboards come in
many shapes and sizes, but the fundamental components of the
breadboard will remain the same:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/breadboard_example_1.png" width="500"></p>

<br>
<p>We’ll get to the
purpose of each of these parts in a moment, but the key to a
breadboard’s usefulness is how the various areas are electrically
connected. Those connections are illustrated here:</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/breadboard_example_2.png" width="500"></p>

<br>
<p>As you can see, each
of the two rails consists of two long row of connections (a red row
in each rail and a blue row in each rail). There are spaces between
the groups of holes in the rail, but the entire row is still
electrically connected as indicated. Also note that the two red rows
are not connected and the two blue rows are not connected – they
are denoted in the same color only because they serve the same
purpose. </p>

<p>In the center of the
board, each vertical column of five holes (shown highlighted in green) is electrically connected
together. While we only highlighted a few columns of five-hole connected strips, in
actuality, every columns of five holes is a connected strip. It’s important
to note that there is no electrical connection across the notch.</p>

<p>If you recall from <a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONCS</a>, in order to have a closed
circuit, electricity must be able to flow from power, through the
circuit, to ground. A breadboard makes it easy to wire a circuit in
this fashion – the rails denote the power and ground of the circuit,
while the rest of the breadboard provides
space for your components and the connections between those
components.</p>

<h2>Powering the Breadboard</h2>

<p>Of course, the circuits you build on your breadboard are going to
require power to operate.  When it comes to providing power to the
breadboard (and to the circuits on them), there are lots of options.
</p>
 
<p>In one of our projects, we use a little 3V lithium battery to power the
breadboard.  In the rest of our projects, we power the breadboard from the
Raspberry Pi, which in turn gets its power from being plugged into a wall
outlet.
Alternatively, if you ever use a breadboard
outside of the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, you'll find that there are power
supplies built specifically for breadboards. And you always have the
option of finding your own power source (battery, solar cell, AC power
adapter, etc) and hooking that up to your breadboard as well.</p>
