  <h2>Controlling Our Character</h2>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, the RaspberrySTEM has an enhanced Minecraft API
  (<code>mcpi</code>) that allows us to control our Minecraft character (Steve)
  and manipulate the Minecraft world. One of the things the API allows us to do
  is to remap the keyboard presses in other ways. For example, normally when we
  press the "W" key on the keyboard, Steve moves forward. But, using the API,
  we could change this -- we could make the "P" key on the keyboard move Steve
  forward instead. Or, better yet, we could control the forward movement of
  Steve using something else entirely...like a button on our RaspberrySTEM
  kit!</p>

  <p>Below, we'll discuss the major actions our character can perform in the
  game, and how we can remap those actions to things other than the standard
  keyboard presses.</p>
  <h2>Control API</h2>

  <p>All of the character control functions are accessed from the
  <code>control</code> module, which we can import with:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import control
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Once <code>control</code> is imported, we can control Steve's movements
  with the functions <code>forward()</code>, <code>backward()</code>,
  <code>left()</code> and <code>right()</code>. Calling those functions without
  arguments is just like pressing and holding the keyboard key that normally
  invokes this movement. The key is not released until you call the function
  with the argument <code>release=True</code>.</p>

  <p>For example, to have Steve walk forward for 2 seconds and then stop, this
  is what the code would look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
control.forward()
time.sleep(2)
control.forward(release=True)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>This is what our code snippet does:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>Line 1 of the program starts moving Steve forward</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Line 2 of the program waits for two seconds (while Steve is
      continuously moving)</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Line 3 of the program stops Steve's movement</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Another way to implement this same functionality (having a key pressed for
  a specific amount of time) is by using the <code>duration=</code> argument
  inside the function. The following code will also have Steve walk forward for
  2 seconds and then stop:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
control.forward(duration=2)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>This one line of code achieves the same thing as the three lines of code
  above.</p>

  <p>Finally, to stop all keys from being pressed, you can use
  <code>control.stop()</code>. For example, to walk both forward and right for
  a second, and then stop, our code might look like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
control.forward()
control.right()
time.sleep(2)
control.stop()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to controlling Steve's movements forward, backwards, left and
  right, we also have the ability to control his other actions...</p>

  <p>One of the main things that Steve does in Minecraft is breaking (smashing)
  blocks. This is typically accomplished using the left mouse button. Using the
  same <code>control</code> module we've been using, we can have Steve smash
  whatever is in front of him like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
control.smash()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Additionally, Steve has the ability to jump, which is typically
  accomplished using the spacebar on the keyboard, and can be implemented in
  our code like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
control.jump()
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2>Current Keyboard/Mouse Mappings</h2>

  <p>Because the <code>control</code> functions simply poll the keyboard and
  mouse presses, there are many additional <code>control</code> commands that
  we can implement in our code -- in fact, there is one for every keypress
  supported by Minecraft.</p>

  <p>For reference, here is the full list of functions accessible by the
  <code>control</code> code:</p>
