      In this project, we continue the development of our Simon-like pattern
      matching game by adding randomized LED blinking.

  <p>In our last project, we wrote some code to flash LEDs in a pre-planned
  sequence. While that's a good start, in our Simon-like game, we're going to
  need to flash LEDs in a random sequence.</p>

  <p>In this project, we're going to make some modifications to the code from
  the last project which will give us a random sequence of LED flashes. In the
  next project, we'll add in the buttons.</p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      randrange() Function
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>The randrange() function simply returns a random number with the range
      provided when the function is called. If one parameter is supplied, the
      random number generated will fall between 1 and that parameter. If two
      parameters are supplied, the random number will fall between the first
      and second parameter, both included.</p>

      <p>We use the randrange() function in our Simon-like game to generate a
      random sequence of LED flashes for our game.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Programming Implementation</h2>

  <p>Starting with the code we left off with in the previous project, the first
  thing we'll need to do is import the function randrange() to create our
  random generation of LED flashes:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
from random import randrange
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Next, instead of filling the list <code>play_order</code> with a
  pre-defined sequence, we're going to make that an empty list that we can use
  to hold our random sequence. To do that, we'll replace the list we created
  previously with a new (empty) list:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
play_order = []
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Finally, we'll have to create our random sequence of LEDs. We'll add a
  random LED to the end of the <code>play_order</code> list. The following line
  of code is a shorthand to append an item to a list (in this case, the item is
  a random number from 0 to 3):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
play_order += [randrange(4)]
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If we add this code to our previous code that includes the play sequence,
  we'll see that we're adding a single random LED flash to our sequence list
  and then flashing it:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = []

play_order += [randrange(4)]

# Play sequence
for light in lights: 
        light.off()

for i in play_order:
        lights[i].on()
        time.sleep(0.4)
        lights[i].off()
        time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If we add a <code>while</code> loop, we can continue to generate a random
  LED and add it to the list each time through the loop. This will play the
  entire sequence of random LED flashes, add a new LED to the sequence, play
  the list again with the new LED added, and then repeat:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = []

# Play sequence
for light in lights: 
        light.off()

while True:
        play_order += [randrange(4)]
        
        for i in play_order:
                lights[i].on()
                time.sleep(0.4)
                lights[i].off()
                time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point --
  when you run it, you will see a random LED flash, then that light will repeat
  with a second random light added, then that 2-light sequence will repeat with
  a third added and so on (the sequence will continue until you stop the
  program):</p>
