<p>In our last project, we wrote some code to flash LEDs in a
pre-planned sequence.  While that's a good start, in our
Simon-like game, we're going to need to flash LEDs in a random
sequence.  </p>
<p>In this project, we're going to make some
modifications to the code from the last project which will give us a
random sequence of LED flashes.  In the next project, we'll
add in
the buttons.</p>

<div class="info">
<div>randrange() Function</div>
<div>
	<p>
	The randrange() function simply returns a random number with the range provided
	when the function is called.  If one parameter is supplied, the random number 
	generated will fall between 1 and that parameter.  If two parameters are supplied,
	the random number will fall between the first and second parameter, both included.
	<p>
	We use the randrange() function in our Simon-like game to generate a random 
	sequence of LED flashes for our game.
</div>
</div>

<h2>Programming Implementation</h2>
<p>Starting with the code we left off with in the
previous project, the first thing we'll need to
do is import the function randrange() to create our random generation
of LED flashes:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>from random import randrange
</textarea></div>

<p>Next, instead of filling the list <code>play_order</code>
with a pre-defined sequence, we're going to make that an empty list
that we can use to hold our random sequence.  To do that,
we'll replace the list we created previously with a new (empty) list:</p>


<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>play_order = []
</textarea></div>


<p>Finally, we'll have to create our random sequence of LEDs.
 We'll add a random LED to the end of the <code>play_order</code> list.  The following
line of code is a shorthand to append an item to a list (in this case, the item is a random
number from 0 to 3):</p>


<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>play_order += [randrange(4)]
</textarea></div>


<p>If we add this code to our previous code that includes the
play sequence, we'll see that we're adding a single random LED flash to
our sequence list and then flashing it:</p><p></p>


<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea># Initialize the LEDs and sequence list
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = []

play_order += [randrange(4)]

# Play sequence
for light in lights: 
	light.off()

for i in play_order:
	lights[i].on()
	time.sleep(0.4)
	lights[i].off()
	time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea></div>


<p>If we add a <code>while</code> loop, we can continue to generate a random
LED and
add it to the list each time through the loop.  This will play
the entire sequence of random LED flashes, add a new LED to the
sequence, play the list again with the new LED added, and then repeat:</p><p></p>


<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea># Initialize the LEDs and sequence list
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = []

# Play sequence
for light in lights: 
	light.off()

while True:
	play_order += [randrange(4)]
	
	for i in play_order:
		lights[i].on()
		time.sleep(0.4)
		lights[i].off()
		time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea></div>

<p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point -- when you 
run it, you will see a random LED flash, then that light will repeat with a second random
light added, then that 2-light sequence will repeat with a third added and so on (the
sequence will continue until you stop the program):</p>
