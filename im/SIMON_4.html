<h1>SIMON 4</h1>
<p>In our last project, we rewrote our previous test code using lists
-- doing this will make all the code we'll be writing in the next
several projects easier to write and easier to understand (both for
ourselves and for others who might read our code). &nbsp;Now we can
start writing code more specific to our game.</p><p>If you're not
familiar with Simon, let me describe how our pattern-matching game will
work. &nbsp;The game will start by flashing an LED at random (and will
play a tone speciific to that LED).&nbsp; You'll then have a short
amount of time to press the button associated with that LED. &nbsp;If
you do that successfully, the game will repeat the first LED flash and
then add a second LED flash at random. &nbsp;Again, you'll need to
remember the pattern and press the correct buttons to replicate the
pattern. &nbsp;Each time you successfully enter the correct sequence,
the game will&nbsp;replay the previous pattern and add a random new LED
flash at the end. &nbsp;If you incorrectly repeat the sequence -- of if
you take too long between button presses -- the game ends.</p><p>To start programming our game, the first thing we want to do is learn how to flash a sequence of LEDs.
&nbsp;For this project, we'll use a planned sequence of LED flashes.
&nbsp;For the next project, we'll expand on that by making the flashing
sequence random.</p><br><h2>Programming Implementation</h2><p>Simon:
