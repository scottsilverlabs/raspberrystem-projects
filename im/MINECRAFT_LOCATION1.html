<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we'll integrate the LED Matrix into our projects.  The LED Matrix
will be used as a map of the Minecraft world, and we'll light up one of the LEDs to
denote our position in the world.  As we move through the Minecraft world, the LED
Matrix will track our movement and plot our position.


<h2>Hardware Setup</h2>

<h2>Writing Our Code</h2>

<p>Our code for this project will contain all the standard pieces
necessary to get Minecraft running -- importing libraries/functions
we'll need, attaching to the Minecraft server and starting Minecraft --
while our project-specific code will completely lie within our game
loop.

<p>Our game loop will do three things:

<ol>
<li><p>First, we'll get the location of our character within the
Minecraft world.</li>
<li><p>Next, we'll determine the relative position of our character
on the 8x8 layout of the LED Matrix.</li>
<li><p>Finally, we'll plot that relative location on the LED Matrix.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Full Code</h3>

<p>
Here is what the full code for this project should look like.  We'll
dig further into the highlighted pieces of code below:
</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1"> <div></div> <textarea>
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control
import time

control.show()
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

SCALE = 25

def scale_to_led(pos, scale)
    led_pos = round(pos/scale + .5*(fb_width - 1))
    led_pos = min(fb.width-1, max(0, led_pos))
	return led_pos
	
fb = FrameBuffer()
while True:
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()

    x = scale_to_led(pos.x, SCALE)
    z = scale_to_led(pos.z, SCALE)

    fb.erase()
    fb.point(z, x)
    fb.show()

    time.sleep(0.01)
</textarea></div>

<p>Much of the code for this project should be self-explanatory
at this point, but there is one section that could probably
use some additional explanation:

<h3>Determining the relative position of our character</h3>

<p>Once we retrieve our position in the Minecraft world using
the <code>getTilePos()</code> function, we need to map that position 
to a relative position on the LED Matrix. We've created a function
called <code>scale_to_led()</code> that can perform this work for
us.  That function takes two inputs:

<ol>
<li><p>The vector position of the location in the Minecraft world; and</li>
<li><p>The scale to which we're shrinking the Minecraft world.</li>
</ol>

<p>The vector position is simply the value returned by <code>getTilePos()</code>
for a particular axis.  For this project, we'll be using the X axis and the Z 
axis to define our two-dimensional location.
 
<p>The scale value is the amount by which we want to shrink the Minecraft
world to fit on the LED Matrix.  While the size of the Minecraft world will
change from game to game -- it's generated randomly when the game starts -- 
it will typically be around 200 units in length and width.  Since we are going
to want to scale from a total length/width of 200 units down to a total 
length/width of 8 units (the length/width of the LED Matrix), our scale
factor should be about 25 (200 / 25 = 8).

<p>Here is a visual representation of what our function will need to do:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 500px" alt="" src="img/minecraft_scale.jpg"></div>

<p>To convert the actual position in the Minecraft world (width of about 200) 
to a scale that matches the size of the LED Matrix (width of 8), we need to divide
our actual position by our scale value.  Next, because that scaling will result
in a value between about -4 and 4 (instead of the 0 to 7 that we need), we 
need to shift the value by the distance from the edge of the LED Matrix to the
center point (<code>fb_width - 1</code>).

<p>Next, we convert our scale value to a whole number between 0 and 7, so that 
we can plot it on the LED Matrix.  We do this by taking the result of the computation
above and using the <code>round()</code> function.

<p>Finally, because we can't be sure of the actual size of the Minecraft world 
(it could be larger than we anticipate), we need to ensure that this whole number 
doesn't fall outside the 0 to 7 range.
 
<p>This is accomplished using the code:

<p><code>min(fb.width-1, max(0, led_pos))</code>

<p>Our function then returns the resulting value between 0 and 7.
