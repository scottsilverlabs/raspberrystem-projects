    <div id=title>BUILDING A FLASHLIGHT</div>
    <div id=description>In this project, we'll put together the work we did in the previous
    projects -- getting GPIO input from the button and controlling the LED with GPIO output --
to create a "flashlight" circuit that will illuminate an LED when the button is pressed.  The 
flashlight will rely on software for both input and output.</div>

<p>In the <a href="USING_BUTTONS_WITH_GPIO.html">GPIO AS INPUTS (READING BUTTONS)</a> project,
we were able to get button input from a
GPIO.  In the <a href="GENERAL_PURPOSE_INPUT-OUTPUT.html">GPIO AS OUTPUTS (CONTROLLING LEDS)</a> project, we were able to control an LED using GPIO.  In this project, we're going to put those concepts together to read 
a button input using one GPIO and use that information toggle an LED using another GPIO.

<h4>Step #1: Wire the button and LED to GPIOs</h4>
<p>For the hardware in this project, we’re going to wire
two completely independent circuits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The
first circuit will consist of a button wired
to a GPIO (like we did in <a href="USING_BUTTONS_WITH_GPIO.html">GPIO AS INPUTS (READING BUTTONS)</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The
second circuit will consist of an LED wired
to a separate GPIO (like we did in <a href="GENERAL_PURPOSE_INPUT-OUTPUT.html">GPIO AS OUTPUTS
(CONTROLLING LEDS)</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is what the breadboard should
look like with the two
circuits wired.  If
you have any
questions about how to wire either of these two circuits, refer back to
the projects referenced above.</p>
<img class="bb" src="img/Flashlight_bb.png">
<p>You’ll notice that our button is
wired to GPIO18 and our LED
is wired to GPIO14.  </p>
<h4>Step #2: Write the code.</h4>
<p>Now that we have the circuits built
and ready to go, it’s
time to write our software.  For
this
project, our software is going to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p> Read
the state of the button (pressed or
released) using a GPIO as input</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  If
the button is pressed, turn on the LED using
a GPIO as output, and if the button is not pressed, turn off the LED
using the
GPIO as output</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the code that will accomplish
this:</p><p></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.gpio import Output

my_button = Button(18)
my_led = Output(14)

if my_button.is_pressed():
	my_led.on()
else:
	my_led.off()
</textarea></div>
<p>Let's to through the code line-by-line and take a look at what
it's doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize
the button (called <code>Button()</code>)</p></li><li>
<p>On Line 2, we import the module we will need to initialize
the LED (called <code>Output()</code>)</p></li><li><p>On Line 4, we initialize our button.  We
call the <code>Button()</code>
function, which returns a "Button object" to our <code>my_button</code> variable.
 We talked about that a bit in <a href="VARIABLES_-_ASSIGNMENTS.html">VARIABLES & ASSIGNMENTS</a>,
but the important thing to understand is that we can now use <code>my_button</code>
to call other GPIO functions that can control our button</p></li><li><p>On Line 5, we initialize our LED.  We
call the <code>Output()</code>
function, which returns a "GPIO Output object" to our <code>my_led </code>variable.
 Again, we talked about that a bit in <a href="VARIABLES_-_ASSIGNMENTS.html">VARIABLES & ASSIGNMENTS</a>,
but the important thing to understand is that we can now use <code>my_led</code>
to call other GPIO functions that can control our LED</p></li>
<li>
<p>On Line 7, we check the state of the button using the <code>is_pressed()</code>
function.  This function will return True if the button is pressed
(this is done by reading the voltage at the GPIO, like we discussed in <a
href="USING_BUTTONS_WITH_GPIO.html">GPIO AS INPUTS (READING BUTTONS)</a>), and will return False if the
button is released</p></li><li><p>On Line 8, if the return from our if statement is True (the button is pressed), we light the LED using the on() function</p></li><li><p>On
Lines 9 and 10, if the return from our if statement is False (the
button is released), we turn off the LED using the off() function</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Notice
that with this code, the button status is only read one time when the
program is run.  So, if you want the LED to illuminate, you need
to be holding the button when you run the code.  If you’re not
holding down the button at the
time the program is run, the code will see that the button is released
and the LED will not illuminate.</p>
<h4>Step #3: Improve the code.</h4>
<p>To make this program more useful, we can put the
code that reads the button into a loop
so that it will
continually read the button state and update the LED every time it
changes.  To do this, we simply put the last four lines of the
code (the lines that test the state of the button and turn the LED on
or off) in a <code>while True:</code> loop, like this:</p><p></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

my_button = Button(18)
my_led = Output(14)

while True:
	if my_button.is_pressed():
		my_led.on()
	else:
		my_led.off()
	time.sleep(.01)
</textarea></div>
<p>Give it a try.  The flashlight will continue to work until you
manually stop the program.</p>
