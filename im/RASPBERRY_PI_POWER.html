      In this project, we'll replace the battery power source we used in the
      previous project with power from the Raspberry Pi.

  <p>We’ve built our first circuit – both on and off the breadboard – using our
  3V battery as our power source. But, there’s no reason we couldn’t power our
  circuits with another power source instead. For example, some breadboards
  come with special built-in power supplies so that you don’t have to use a
  battery or another external power source.</p>

  <p>One of the features of the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit is that it can use
  the power and ground from the Raspberry Pi to power the breadboard. The power
  is made available to the breadboard through the Lid Connector Board (the
  green board on the top of the lid - see diagrams below).</p>

  <p>In this project, we’re going to replace the 3V battery we’ve been using as
  our power supply with the internal power provided by the Raspberry Pi. Other
  than replacing the battery with a different power source, our circuit will
  remain exactly the same. In fact, our schematic won't change, other than to
  replace the power source with 3.3V (the voltage of the Raspberry Pi power
  source) from the 3V provided by the battery.</p>

  <p>Here is a reminder of that schematic:</p><img class="schematic" style=
  "width: 200px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png" alt="">

  <p>And here are step-by-step instructions for how we make the change to the
  circuit:</p>
  <h4>Step #1: Disconnect the 3V battery</h4>

  <p>First, we need to disconnect our existing power source. From the
  breadboard, remove the power and ground wires leading from the battery.</p>

  <p>Your breadboard should now look like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Breadboard_Remove_Battery_bb.png" alt="">
  <h4>Step #2: Add power and ground from the Lid Connector Board</h4>

  <p>We can now add power from the connect board to the breadboard. This is
  accomplished by running a wire from one of the pins labeled “3.3V” on the Lid
  Connector Board to the red (power) row, thus providing power to the entire
  row. And then running a wire from the blue (ground) row to one of the pins
  labeled “GND” on the Lid Connector Board.</p>

  <p>At this point, our LED should once again be lit, and here’s what our
  breadboard should now look like:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png" alt="">

  <p>We have successfully replaced the battery (our previous power and ground
  source) with power and ground coming directly from the Raspberry Pi. For all
  future projects, we'll be using the power/ground from the Raspberry Pi to
  power our circuits.</p>

      A Note About Wires
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>Your RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit comes with a bag of 65 wires in
      assorted colors and lengths, as well as a smaller bag of 20 half-inch
      green wires. All the wires provided in the kit (regardless of color and
      length) work exactly the same way and are completely interchangeable.
      While you can use any wire for any purpose, there are some conventions
      that will help make wiring and troubleshooting your circuits much
      easier:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>

          <p>You should typically try to use the shortest length of wire
          possible that will allow you to connect the points you are trying to
          connect. Doing this will help keep your breadboard from looking like
          a big mess of wires that are hard to follow and will make accessing
          your components easier.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Along with the above point, using the small green wires (which sit
          flush with the breadboard) are typically preferred over the longer
          wires when you just a short run from one component to another.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>While not required, convention is to use red wires to indicate
          power and black wires to indicate ground. Again, this isn't required,
          but by doing this, it will be quicker to determine how the key points
          of your circuit (power and ground) are wired at any given time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>When you start wiring lots of components, your breadboard can get
          a little messy and it can be difficult to determine where a wire
          starts and ends. For this reason, we recommend trying to use
          different color wires within your circuits. This will make
          troubleshooting much easier.</p>
