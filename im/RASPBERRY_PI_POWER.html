<p>We’ve built our
first circuit – both on and off the breadboard – using our 3V
battery as our power source. But, there’s no reason we couldn’t
power our circuits with another power source instead. For example, some
breadboards come with special built-in power supplies so that you
don’t have to use a battery or another external power source.</p>
<p>One of the features
of the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit is that it can use the
power and
ground from the RaspberrySTEM Base to power the breadboard on the
Lid. The power is actually coming from the Raspberry Pi computer,
and is made available to the breadboard through the connector board
at the top of the lid.</p>
<p>In this project,
we’re going to replace the 3V battery we’ve been using as our
power supply with the internal power provided by the RaspberrySTEM
and the Raspberry Pi. &nbsp;Other than replacing the battery with a
different power source, our circuit will remain exactly the same.
&nbsp;In fact, our schematic won't change, other than to replace
the
power source with 3.3V (the voltage of the Raspberry Pi power source)
from the 3V provided by the battery. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a reminder of that schematic:</p>
<br>
<img class="schematic" style="width: 200px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png">
<br>
<p>And here are step-by-step instructions for how we make the
change to the circuit:<br>
</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1:
&nbsp;Disconnect the 3V battery</p>
<p>First,
we need to disconnect our existing power source. From the
breadboard, remove the power and ground wires leading from the
battery.</p>
<p>Your
breadboard should now look like this:</p>
<br>
<img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Remove_Battery_bb.png">
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2: &nbsp;Add power
and ground from the connector board</p>
<p>We
can now add power from the connect board to the breadboard. This is
accomplished by running a wire from one of the pins labeled “3.3V”
on the lid connector to the red (power) row, thus providing power to
the entire row. And then running a wire from the blue (ground) row
to one of the pins labeled “GND” on the lid connector.</p>
<p>At
this point, our LED should once again be lit, and here’s what our
breadboard should now look like:</p>
<br>
<img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.png">
<br>
<p>We have successfully replaced the battery (our previous power
and ground source) with power and ground coming directly from the
Raspberry Pi. &nbsp;For all future projects, we'll be using the
power/ground from the Raspberry Pi to power our circuits. &nbsp;<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></span>

<div>A Note About Wires</div>
<div>
<p>Your RaspberrySTEM kit comes with a bag of 65 wires in
assorted colors and lengths, as well as a smaller bag of 20 half-inch
green wires. All the wires
provided in the kit (regardless of color and length) work exactly the
same way and are completely interchangeable. While you can use any wire
for any purpose,
there are some conventions that will help make wiring and
troubleshooting your circuits much easier:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You should typically try to use the shortest length of
wire possible that will allow you to connect the points you are trying
to connect. Doing this will
help keep your breadboard from looking like a big mess of wires that
are hard to follow and will make accessing your components easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along with the above point, using the small green wires
(which sit flush with
the breadboard) are typically preferred over the longer wires when you
just
a short run from one component to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While not required,
convention is to use red wires to indicate power and black wires to
indicate ground. Again, this isn't required, but by doing this, it will
be quicker to determine how the key points of your circuit (power and
ground) are wired at any given time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you start wiring lots of
components, your breadboard can get a little messy and it can be
difficult to determine where a wire starts and ends. For
this reason, we recommend trying to use different color wires within
your circuits. This will make troubleshooting much easier.</p>
</li>
