<h1>RASPBERRY PI POWER</h1>
<p>We’ve built our
first circuit – both on and off the breadboard – using our 3V
battery as our power source.  But, there’s no reason we couldn’t
power our circuits with another power source.  For example, some
breadboards come with special built-in power supplies so that you
don’t have to use a battery or another external power source.</p>
<p>One of the features
of the RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup> is that it can use the power and
ground from the RaspberrySTEM base to power the breadboard on the
lid.  The power is actually coming from the Raspberry Pi computer,
and is made available to the breadboard through the connector board
at the top of the lid.</p>
<p>In this project,
we’re going to replace the 3V battery we’ve been using as our
power supply with the internal power provided by the RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup>
and the Raspberry Pi.  
</p>
<p>Here are is how we
do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><b>Disconnect the 3V battery.</b></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">First,
we need to disconnect our existing power source.  From the
breadboard, remove the power and ground wires leading from the
battery.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Your
breadboard should now look like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_bf7b3c4.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="222" width="669"></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lighting an LED (Battery removed) Diagram</span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: center;"></p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p><b>Add power from the connector
	board.</b></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">We
can now add power from the connect board to the breadboard.  This is
accomplished by running a wire from one of the pins labeled “3.3V”
on the lid connector to the red (power) row, thus providing power to
the entire row.  And then running a wire from the blue (ground) row
to one of the pins labeled “GND” on the lid connector.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">At
this point, our LED should once again be lit, and here’s what our
breadboard should now look like:</p>
