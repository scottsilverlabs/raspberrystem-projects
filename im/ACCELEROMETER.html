<h1>ACCELEROMETER</h1>
<p>Do you have smart phone or an iPad that switches the screen
orientation when you rotate it? &nbsp;Ever wonder how that works?
&nbsp;It's done using a component called an accelerometer, and
there are lots of cool applications for them when designing and
building electronics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The RaspberrySTEM kit includes it's own accelerometer -- it's
in the bag marked <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accelerometer
RaspberrySTEM Cell</span>. &nbsp;Feel free to pull it out
now...</p>
<p>By plugging in the accelerometer to the RaspberrySTEM and then
writing code to get input from it, we can turn our RaspberrySTEM into a
controller that can detect magnitude of movement (acceleration) along
all three axes -- left/right, front/back and up/down. &nbsp;From
this information, we can determine the orientation of the kit&nbsp;
and/or the vector (speed and direction) of movement at a given time.
&nbsp;I know that might sound a little confusing, but follow along
and you'll see what we mean.</p>
<p>Your Accelerometer RaspberrySTEM Cell contains a single part
-- the accelerometer circuit board -- that looks like this (from the top):</p><p></p>

<h2>Wiring Your Accelerometer</h2>
<p>Let's wire up your accelerometer and write some code to get it
working...</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1: &nbsp;Place the
accelerometer on the breadboard<br>
</p>
<p>The accelerometer has six pins coming from the bottom of it.
&nbsp;It should be inserted into the breadboard such that each pin sits
in a different connect strip, and you should ensure that at least one
other hole is usable in each connect strip where the accelerometer sits.</p><p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2: &nbsp;Attach
power and ground</p>
<p>To wire the accelerometer, the first thing you'll need to do is to
run a wire from VCC on the accelerometer to 3.3V power somewhere on the
breadboard. &nbsp;Next, run a wire from GND on the accelerometer to GND
somewhere on the breadboard.</p><p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #3: &nbsp;Attach
SDA pin to the connector board</p>
<p>Next, you'll need to attach a wire from the connect strip attached
to the SDA pin on the accelerometer to the SDA pin on the connector
board.</p><p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #4: &nbsp;Attach
SCL pin to the connector board</p>
<p>Finally, you'll attach&nbsp;a wire from the connect strip attached to the SCL pin on the accelerometer to the SCL pin on the connector board.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Here is what your breadboard should look like once the accelerometer is properly wired:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><img style="width: 1012px; height: 721px;" alt="" src="img/LED_Matrix_Accel_bb.png"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></div><h2>Testing Your Accelerometer</h2>
<p>Let's write some code to test your accelerometer and see
how it works:</p><p></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>from rstem.accel import Accel
import time
accel = Accel()
while True:
    x_force, y_force, z_force = accel.forces()
    print(x_force, y_force, z_force)
    time.sleep(.1)
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize
and get information from the accelerometer (called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Accel()</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 2, we import the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">time</span>
module, as we're going to be using a loop and will want to slow the
repetition of the loop down a bit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 4, we initialize our accelerometer. &nbsp;We
call the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Accel()</span>
function, which returns an "accelerometer object" to our <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">accel </span>variable.
&nbsp;We talked about that a bit in <a href="VARIABLES_-_ASSIGNMENTS.html">Variables &amp; Assignments</a>,
but the important thing to understand is that we can now use <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">accel</span>
to call other accelerometer functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 6, we start a loop (this is where we'll spend all
of our time once we run the program)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 7, we call the accelerometer function <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">forces()</span>,
which returns three values, representing the forces in the x-direction,
y-direction and z-direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 8, we print those three values to the screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On
Line 9, we pause briefly (so we don't overwork the processor) and then
return to the top of the loop where we read the new values from the
accelerometer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running Your Code</h2>
<p>If you run your test code, what you should
immediately see is that your Output Window starts filling up with
numbers. &nbsp;These numbers -- three per line -- indicate the
relative
movement of the RaspberrySTEM (specifically, the accelerometer we wired
on the breadboard), as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The
first number indicates the left/right tilt of the RaspberrySTEM -- if
you tilt to the left, the number increases towards 1 and if you tilt to
the right, the number decreases towards -1.</p></li><li><p>The second number indicates the front/back tilt of the accelerometer -- if you tilt backwards, the number increases towards 1 and if you tilt forwards, the number decreases towards -1.</p></li><li><p>The
third number indicates the up/down movement of the accelerometer -- if
you move it upwards, the number increases towards 1 and if you move it
downwards, the number decreases towards -1.</p></li></ul><p>Play around
with the RaspberrySTEM and try to get a feel for how different
movements and rotations affect the numbers on the screen. &nbsp;In
future projects, we'll be using this functionality to turn the
RaspberrySTEM into a game controller.</p>
