<p>Do you have smart phone or an iPad that switches the screen
orientation when you rotate it? &nbsp;Ever wonder how that works?
&nbsp;It's done using a component called an accelerometer, and
there are lots of cool applications for them when designing and
building electronics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit includes it's own accelerometer -- it's
in the bag marked <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accelerometer
RaspberrySTEM Cell</span>. &nbsp;Feel free to pull it out
now...</p>
<p>By plugging in the accelerometer to the RaspberrySTEM and then
writing code to get input from it, we can turn our RaspberrySTEM into a
controller that can detect magnitude of movement (acceleration) along
all three axes -- left/right, front/back and up/down. &nbsp;From
this information, we can determine the orientation of the kit&nbsp;
and/or the vector (speed and direction) of movement at a given time.
&nbsp;we know that might sound a little confusing, but follow along
and you'll see what we mean.</p>
<p>Your Accelerometer RaspberrySTEM Cell contains a single part
-- the accelerometer circuit board -- that looks like this (from the top):</p><p></p>

<h2>Wiring Your Accelerometer</h2>
<p>Let's wire up your accelerometer and write some code to get it
working...</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1: &nbsp;Place the
accelerometer on the breadboard<br>
</p>
<p>The accelerometer has six pins.  It should be inserted into the breadboard such 
that each pin sits in a different connect strip, and you should ensure that at least one
other hole is usable in each connect strip where the accelerometer sits.  When inserting
the accelerometer into the breadboard, don't be afraid to apply some pressure from the
top -- the bottom of the black plastic connectors should touch the breadboard.</p>
<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"></p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2: &nbsp;Attach
power and ground</p>
<p>To wire the accelerometer, the first thing you'll need to do is to
run a wire from VCC on the accelerometer to 3.3V power somewhere on the
breadboard. &nbsp;Next, run a wire from GND on the accelerometer to GND
somewhere on the breadboard. (See diagram below)</p>
<br>
    <div class="info">
    <div>WARNING: ACCELEROMETER HOOK-UP</div>
    <div>
    <p>It
is very important to note that the power and the ground of the
accelerometer must be connected appropriately -- 3.3V power from the
Lid Connector Board must be connected
to VCC on the accelerometer and GND from the Lid Connector Board must be
attached to GND on the accelerometer. If the accelerometer is turned
around 180 degrees, you'll notice
that VCC will be located where GND should be and vice-versa.</p>  

<p>If you hook up GND on the accelerometer to 3.3V on the Lid Connector Board
and you hook up VCC on the accelerometer to GND on the Lid Connector Board,
there is a good chance that you will destroy the accelerometer chip (it
will likely get warm and start to smoke). So, be very careful that you
hook
up the chip as indicated above and below.
</p>
    </div>
    </div>

<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #3: &nbsp;Attach
SDA pin to the Lid Connector Board</p>
<p>Next, you'll need to attach a wire from the connect strip attached
to the SDA pin on the accelerometer to the SDA pin on the 
Lid Connector Board. (See diagram below)</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #4: &nbsp;Attach
SCL pin to the Lid Connector Board</p>
<p>Finally, you'll attach&nbsp;a wire from the connect strip attached
to the SCL pin on the accelerometer to the SCL pin on the 
Lid Connector Board. (See diagram below)</p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Here is what your breadboard should look like once the accelerometer is properly wired:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_Accel_bb.png"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></div><h2>Testing Your Accelerometer</h2>
<p>Let's write some code to test your accelerometer and see
how it works:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>from rstem.accel import Accel
import time

accel = Accel()

while True:
	x_force, y_force, z_force = accel.forces()
	print(x_force, y_force, z_force)
	time.sleep(.1)
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize
and get information from the accelerometer (called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Accel()</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 2, we import the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">time</span>
module, as we're going to be using a loop and will want to slow the
repetition of the loop down a bit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 4, we initialize our accelerometer. &nbsp;We
call the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Accel()</span>
function, which returns an "accelerometer object" to our <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">accel </span>variable.
&nbsp;We talked about that a bit in <a href="VARIABLES_-_ASSIGNMENTS.html">VARIABLES & ASSIGNMENTS</a>,
but the important thing to understand is that we can now use <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">accel</span>
to call other accelerometer functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 6, we start a loop (this is where we'll spend all
of our time once we run the program)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 7, we call the accelerometer function <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">forces()</span>,
which returns three values, representing the forces in the x-direction,
y-direction and z-direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 8, we print those three values to the screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On
Line 9, we pause briefly (so we don't overwork the processor) and then
return to the top of the loop where we read the new values from the
accelerometer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running Your Code</h2>
<p>If you run your test code, what you should
immediately see is that your Output Window starts filling up with
numbers. &nbsp;These numbers -- three per line -- indicate the
relative
movement of the RaspberrySTEM (specifically, the accelerometer we wired
on the breadboard), as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The
first number indicates the left/right tilt of the RaspberrySTEM -- if
you tilt to the left, the number increases towards 1 and if you tilt to
the right, the number decreases towards -1</p></li>
	<li><p>The
second number indicates the front/back tilt of the accelerometer -- if
you tilt backwards, the number increases towards 1 and if you tilt
forwards, the number decreases towards -1</p></li>
	<li><p>The
third number indicates the up/down movement of the accelerometer -- if
you move it upwards, the number increases towards 1 and if you move it
downwards, the number decreases towards -1</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on that, if you sit your RaspberrySTEM down on a flat surface, you should
expect the first number to be 0, the second number to be 0 and the third number to be
1.  In reality, the accelerometer is <b>very</b> sensitive, and it's unlikely that your
surface is 100% flat, so you'll probably see readings that are very slightly off from 
those numbers.</p>
<p>Play around
with the RaspberrySTEM and try to get a feel for how different
movements and rotations affect the numbers on the screen. &nbsp;In
future projects, we'll be using this functionality to turn the
RaspberrySTEM into a game controller.</p>
