  <p>Do you have a smart phone or an iPad that switches the screen orientation
  when you rotate it? Ever wonder how that works? It's done using a component
  called an accelerometer, and there are lots of cool applications for them
  when designing and building electronics.</p>

  <p>The RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit includes its own accelerometer -- it's in
  the bag marked <strong>Accelerometer RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong>. Feel free
  to pull it out now.</p>

  <p>By plugging in the accelerometer to the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit and then
  writing code to get input from it, we can turn our RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit
  into a controller that can detect changes in movement (acceleration) along
  all three axes -- left/right, front/back and up/down. From this information,
  we can determine the orientation of the kit and/or the vector (speed and
  direction) of movement at a given time.</p>

  <p>Your Accelerometer RaspberrySTEM Cell contains a single part -- the
  accelerometer circuit board -- that looks like this (from the top):</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 110px; height: 256px;"
  alt="" src="img/accel.jpg"></div>

  <p>On the circuit board above, you'll see a diagram with 3 arrows, labeled X,
  Y and Z. Note that it <i>looks</i> like only two arrows, X and Y. The third
  arrow, the Z arrow, is somewhat hidden -- it is a circle with a dot. The Z
  arrow is actually pointing up perpendicularly from the circuit board, and it
  shows the front tip of the arrow.</p>

  <p>The accelerometer measures forces -- this can be the forces it feels when
  you move it around, or simply the force of gravity. When the RaspberrySTEM
  CREATOR Kit is sitting on a table and not moving, it reports just the force
  of gravity, in the X, Y, and Z directions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>When an arrow points up, the force will be 1.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>When an arrow points down, the force will be -1.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>When an arrow points neither up nor down (perpendicular to the force
      of gravity), the force will be 0.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>When an arrow is tilted somewhere in between directly down and
      directly up, then the force will be somewhere in between -1 and 1.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, when the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit is sitting flat on a
  table, the Z arrow points up, and the X and Y arrow are parallel with the
  table. In that case, the accelerometer will report an X, Y and Z of
  approximately 0, 0, and 1. If you flip the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit over, so
  the Z arrow points down towards the earth, the accelerometer will report an
  X, Y and Z of approximately 0, 0, and -1.</p>
  <h2>Wiring Your Accelerometer</h2>

  <p>Let's wire up your accelerometer and write some code to get it
  working.</p>
  <h4>Step #1: Place the accelerometer on the breadboard</h4>

  <p>The accelerometer has six pins. It should be inserted into the breadboard
  such that each pin sits in a different connect strip, and you should ensure
  that at least one other hole is usable in each connect strip where the
  accelerometer sits. When inserting the accelerometer into the breadboard,
  don't be afraid to apply some pressure from the top -- the bottom of the
  black plastic connectors should touch the breadboard.</p>
  <h4>Step #2: Connect the accelerometer</h4>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      WARNING: ACCELEROMETER HOOK-UP
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>It is very important to note that the power and the ground of the
      accelerometer must be connected appropriately, otherwise there is a good
      chance that you will destroy the accelerometer chip (it will likely get
      warm and start to smoke). So, be very careful that you hook up the chip
      as shown below.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With four wires, wire up the accelerometer as show below.
  Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>Wire GND on the accelerometer to GND on the breadboard.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Wire VCC on the accelerometer to 3.3V power on the breadboard.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Wire SCL on the accelerometer to SCL on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Wire SDA on the accelerometer to SDA on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is what your breadboard should look like once the accelerometer is
  properly wired (the LED Matrix in this picture can be ignored):</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src=
  "img/LED_Matrix_Accel_bb.png" alt=""></div>
  <h2>Testing Your Accelerometer</h2>

  <p>Let's write some code to test your accelerometer and see how it works:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
import time

accel = Accel()

while True:
        x_force, y_force, z_force = accel.forces()
        print(x_force, y_force, z_force)
        time.sleep(.1)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize and get
      information from the accelerometer (called <code>Accel()</code>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 2, we import the <code>time</code> module, as we're going to
      be using a loop and will want to slow the repetition of the loop down a
      bit</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 4, we initialize our accelerometer. We call the
      <code>Accel()</code> function, which returns an "accelerometer object" to
      our <code>accel</code> variable. We talked about that a bit in <a href=
      "VARIABLES_-_ASSIGNMENTS.html">VARIABLES &amp; ASSIGNMENTS</a>, but the
      important thing to understand is that we can now use <code>accel</code>
      to call other accelerometer functions</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 6, we start a loop (this is where we'll spend all of our time
      once we run the program)</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 7, we call the accelerometer function <code>forces()</code>,
      which returns three values, representing the forces in the x-direction,
      y-direction and z-direction</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 8, we print those three values to the screen</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 9, we pause briefly (so we don't overwork the processor) and
      then return to the top of the loop where we read the new values from the
      accelerometer</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Running Your Code</h2>

  <p>If you run your test code, what you should immediately see is that your
  Output Window starts filling up with numbers. These three numbers on each
  line are the X, Y and Z forces.</p>

  <p>If you sit your RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit down on a flat surface, you
  should expect the first number to be 0, the second number to be 0 and the
  third number to be 1. In reality, the accelerometer is <strong>very</strong>
  sensitive, and it's unlikely that your surface is 100% flat, so you'll
  probably see readings that are very slightly off from those numbers.</p>

  <p>Play around with the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit and try to get a feel for
  how different movements and rotations affect the numbers on the screen. In
  future projects, we'll be using this functionality to turn the RaspberrySTEM
  CREATOR Kit into a game controller.</p>
