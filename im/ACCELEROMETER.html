<h1>ACCELEROMETER</h1>
<p>Do you have smart phone or an iPad that switches the screen
orientation when you rotate it? &nbsp;Ever wonder how that works?
&nbsp;It's done using a component called an accelerometer, and
there are lots of cool applications for them when designing and
building electronics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The RaspberrySTEM kit includes it's own accelerometer -- it's
in the bag marked <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accelerometer
RaspberrySTEM Cell</span>. &nbsp;Feel free to pull it out
now...</p>
<p>By plugging in the accelerometer to the RaspberrySTEM and then
writing code to get input from it, we can turn our RaspberrySTEM into a
controller that can detect magnitude of movement (acceleration) along
all three axes -- left/right, front/back and up/down. &nbsp;From
this information, we can determine the orientation of the kit&nbsp;
and/or the vector (speed and direction) of movement at a given time.
&nbsp;I know that might sound a little confusing, but follow along
and you'll see what we mean.</p>
<p>Your Accelerometer RaspberrySTEM Cell contains a single part
-- the accelerometer circuit board -- that looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>How the Accelerometer Works</h2>
<h2>Wiring Your Accelerometer</h2>
<p>Let's wire up your accelerometer and write some code to get it
working...</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1: &nbsp;Place the
accelerometer on the breadboard<br>
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2: &nbsp;Attach
power and ground</p>
<p>...</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #3: &nbsp;Attach
SDA pin to the connector board</p>
<p>...</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #4: &nbsp;Attach
SCL pin to the connector board</p>
<p>...</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Testing Your Accelerometer</h2>
<p>Now let's write some code to test your accelerometer and see
how it works:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>from rstem.accel import Accel
import time
accel = Accel()
while True:
x_force, y_force, z_force = accel.forces()
print(x_force, y_force, z_force)
time.sleep(.01)
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize
and get information from the accelerometer (called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Accel()</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 2, we import the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">time</span>
module, as we're going to be using a loop and will want to slow the
repetition of the loop down a bit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 4, we initialize our accelerometer. &nbsp;We
call the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Accel()</span>
function, which returns an "accelerometer object" to our <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">accel </span>variable.
&nbsp;We talked about that a bit in <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Variables...</span>,
but the important thing to understand is that we can now use <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">accel</span>
to call other accelerometer functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 6, we start a loop (this is where we'll spend all
of our time once we run the program)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 7, we call the accelerometer function <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">forces()</span>,
which returns three values, representing the forces in the x-direction,
y-direction and z-direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 8, we print those three values to the screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On
Line 9, we pause briefly (so we don't overwork the processor) and then
return to the top of the loop where we read the new values from the
accelerometer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running Your Code</h2>
<p>If you run your test code, what you should
immediately see is that your Output Window starts filling up with
numbers. &nbsp;These numbers -- three per line -- indicate the
relative
movement of the RaspberrySTEM (specifically, the accelerometer we wired
on the breadboard). &nbsp;The first number indicates the<br>
<br>
If you
move tilt, pan and rotate the RaspberrySTEM, you'll notice that the
numbers being printed to the screen continue to change, with all the
numbers generally between -1 and 1.</p>
