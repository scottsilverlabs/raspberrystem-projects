<p>Do you have smart phone or an iPad that switches the screen
orientation when you rotate it?  Ever wonder how that works?
 It's done using a component called an accelerometer, and
there are lots of cool applications for them when designing and
building electronics.  </p>
<p>The RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit includes its own accelerometer -- it's
in the bag marked <strong>Accelerometer
RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong>.  Feel free to pull it out
now...</p>
<p>By plugging in the accelerometer to the RaspberrySTEM and then
writing code to get input from it, we can turn our RaspberrySTEM into a
controller that can detect magnitude of movement (acceleration) along
all three axes -- left/right, front/back and up/down.  From
this information, we can determine the orientation of the kit 
and/or the vector (speed and direction) of movement at a given time.
 We know that might sound a little confusing, but follow along
and you'll see what we mean.</p>
<p>Your Accelerometer RaspberrySTEM Cell contains a single part
-- the accelerometer circuit board -- that looks like this (from the top):</p><p></p>

<h2>Wiring Your Accelerometer</h2>
<p>Let's wire up your accelerometer and write some code to get it
working...</p>

<p><strong>Step #1:  Place the
accelerometer on the breadboard
</strong></p>

<p>The accelerometer has six pins.  It should be inserted into the breadboard such 
that each pin sits in a different connect strip, and you should ensure that at least one
other hole is usable in each connect strip where the accelerometer sits.  When inserting
the accelerometer into the breadboard, don't be afraid to apply some pressure from the
top -- the bottom of the black plastic connectors should touch the breadboard.</p>


<p><strong>
Step #2:  Connect the accelerometer
</strong></p>
    <div class="info">
    <div>WARNING: ACCELEROMETER HOOK-UP</div>
    <div>
    <p>It
is very important to note that the power and the ground of the
accelerometer must be connected appropriately, otherwise
there is a good chance that you will destroy the accelerometer chip (it
will likely get warm and start to smoke). So, be very careful that you
hook
up the chip as shown below.

    </div>
    </div>


<p>
With four wires, wire up the accelerometer as show below.  Specifically:
<ul>
<li><p>
Wire GND on the accelerometer to GND on the breadboard.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Wire VCC on the accelerometer to 3.3V power on the breadboard.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Wire SCL on the accelerometer to SCL on the Lid Connector Board.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Wire SDA on the accelerometer to SDA on the Lid Connector Board.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is what your breadboard should look
like once the accelerometer is properly wired (the LED Matrix in this picture can be ignored):
</p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_Accel_bb.png"></div><h2>Testing Your Accelerometer</h2>
<p>Let's write some code to test your accelerometer and see
how it works:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>from rstem.accel import Accel
import time

accel = Accel()

while True:
	x_force, y_force, z_force = accel.forces()
	print(x_force, y_force, z_force)
	time.sleep(.1)
</textarea></div>

<p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize
and get information from the accelerometer (called <code>Accel()</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 2, we import the <code>time</code>
module, as we're going to be using a loop and will want to slow the
repetition of the loop down a bit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 4, we initialize our accelerometer.  We
call the <code>Accel()</code>
function, which returns an "accelerometer object" to our <code>accel </code>variable.
 We talked about that a bit in <a href="VARIABLES_-_ASSIGNMENTS.html">VARIABLES & ASSIGNMENTS</a>,
but the important thing to understand is that we can now use <code>accel</code>
to call other accelerometer functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 6, we start a loop (this is where we'll spend all
of our time once we run the program)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 7, we call the accelerometer function <code>forces()</code>,
which returns three values, representing the forces in the x-direction,
y-direction and z-direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Line 8, we print those three values to the screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On
Line 9, we pause briefly (so we don't overwork the processor) and then
return to the top of the loop where we read the new values from the
accelerometer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running Your Code</h2>
<p>If you run your test code, what you should
immediately see is that your Output Window starts filling up with
numbers.  These numbers -- three per line -- indicate the
relative
movement of the RaspberrySTEM (specifically, the accelerometer we wired
on the breadboard), as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The
first number indicates the left/right tilt of the RaspberrySTEM -- if
you tilt to the left, the number increases towards 1 and if you tilt to
the right, the number decreases towards -1</p></li>
	<li><p>The
second number indicates the front/back tilt of the accelerometer -- if
you tilt backwards, the number increases towards 1 and if you tilt
forwards, the number decreases towards -1</p></li>
	<li><p>The
third number indicates the up/down movement of the accelerometer -- if
you move it upwards, the number increases towards 1 and if you move it
downwards, the number decreases towards -1</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on that, if you sit your RaspberrySTEM down on a flat surface, you should
expect the first number to be 0, the second number to be 0 and the third number to be
1.  In reality, the accelerometer is <strong>very</strong> sensitive, and it's unlikely that your
surface is 100% flat, so you'll probably see readings that are very slightly off from 
those numbers.</p>
<p>Play around
with the RaspberrySTEM and try to get a feel for how different
movements and rotations affect the numbers on the screen.  In
future projects, we'll be using this functionality to turn the
RaspberrySTEM into a game controller.</p>
