<h1>INTRODUCTION TO THE RDE</h1>
<p>If you’re reading
this, you’ve successfully built your RaspberrySTEM, connected
it to the monitor and loaded your RaspberrySTEM Development
Environment (RDE) – you’re now ready to get started with the projects!</p>
<p>Here is (generally)
what your RDE should look like:</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 100%;" alt="" src="img/IDE.jpg"></p>
<p>The first thing
you’ll likely notice is that the screen is split down the middle,
with the left side in blue and the right side in white (you’re
probably reading this on the right-hand side of the screen right
now).  The left (blue) side is also split into two pieces.  
</p>
<p>Below, we’ll
discuss each of these three sections of the RDE and how they work.</p>
<h2>
<b>Code Window</b></h2>
<p>The Code Window is the area in the upper-left portion of the screen:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 75%; " src="img/Code Window.png"></p>
<p>At the top left side of the window 
are four clickable icons.  To the right of those icons is the name of the file
you're editing.
Below the icons is the area where you write and edit your code.
</p>
<p>The four clickable icons are: </p>
<table style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><tbody><tr><td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/play.png"></td><td><p>This is the “Play”
icon.  When you click this icon, your code will
execute (also called "running your code").</p></td></tr><tr><td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/folder.png"></td><td><p align="center">This is the “File”
icon.  When you click this icon, a list of files will pop up so that
you can get back to code you have previously saved.  The popup will
look like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: 1px solid; width: 300px;" alt="" src="img/file_open.png"></p><p>From this menu you can do three things:</p>
<ul><li><p>
	To create a new file, click on the “New File” bar</p>
	</li><li><p>
	To open a previously saved file, click on the file name of the file
	you’d like to open</p>
	</li><li><p>
	To change the name or to duplicate an existing file, click on the
	“Edit” icon to the right of the file you’d like to change</p>
</li></ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/save.png"></td><td><p>This is the “Save”
icon.  When you click this icon, your code will be
saved under the current file name.  If you’d like to change the
name of the file, use the “File” icon mentioned above.</p></td></tr><tr><td><img
style="width: 40px;" src="img/theme.png"></td><td><p>This is the
“Settings” icon.  When you click this icon, you will be prompted
to change various settings or to shut down the RDE.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Note that by
clicking the two arrows to the right of the filename, you can expand
or collapse this window.</p><p></p>


<h2><b>Output Window</b></h2>
<p>Here is the window
you should see in the lower-left portion of the screen:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 75%; " src="img/Program Output.png"></p>
<p>This is called the
Output Window is there is where your program will display information about the program status. </p>
<p>For example, you
may tell your program to print something to this area.  Or, if your
program has an error, the error would be displayed in this area. 
This area will also indicate if your program has finished running or
you have stopped it.</p><p></p>
<h2><b>Projects &amp;
Documentation Window</b></h2>
<p>On the right-hand
side of the screen, you should see a window that resembles this:</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid; display: block; margin: auto; width: 60%; " src="img/PG Window.jpg"></p>
<p>This is the Projects
&amp; Documentation Window, and it consists of two parts:</p><p></p>
<ol>
	<li><p>
	<b>Navigation Menu</b></p>
</li>
<p>The Icon Menu
consists of four clickable navigation icons, each of which serves a
specific function.  Let’s look at the four icons individually:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>
<img style="width: 40px;" src="img/back.png">
</td><td><p>Clicking the
“Back” arrow will step you back through your viewing history.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<img style="width: 40px;" src="img/forward.png">
</td><td><p>Clicking the
“Forward” arrow will step you forward through your viewing
history (if you had previously stepped backwards).</p></td></tr><tr><td>
<img style="width: 40px;" src="img/home.png">
</td><td><p>The “Home” icon
will take you to the home page list of all the projects (as seen in
the example).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<img style="width: 40px;" src="img/api.png">
</td><td><p>The “API” icon
will take you to the list of custom APIs (we'll discuss what that is later) available as
part of the RaspberrySTEM.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
	<li><p>
	<b>Projects &amp; Documentation</b></p>
</li>
<p>Below the Navigation
Menu is the view of the projects and documentation available as part
of the RaspberrySTEM platform.  Any parts of the
documentation that are underlined in blue are clickable hyperlinks
that will take you to other parts of the documentation or projects.</p>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have a
basic overview of the RDE, it’s time to write and run your first
program.  We call this Project #1, and like all the RaspberrySTEM
projects, it’s available in the Projects &amp; Documentation
Window.  
</p>
<p>To start working on Project #1, click the <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">next</span> link below...</p>
