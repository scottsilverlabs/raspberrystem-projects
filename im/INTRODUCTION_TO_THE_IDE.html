  <h1>INTRODUCTION TO THE RDE</h1>

  <p>If you’re reading this, you’ve successfully built your RaspberrySTEM
  CREATOR Kit, connected it to the monitor and loaded your RaspberrySTEM
  Development Environment (RDE). You’re now ready to get started with the
  projects!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Here is (generally) what your RDE should look like:</p>

  <p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 100%;" alt="" src=
  "img/IDE.jpg"></p>

  <p>The first thing you’ll likely notice is that the screen is split down the
  middle, with the left side in blue and the right side in white (you’re
  probably reading this on the right-hand side of the screen right now). The
  left (blue) side is also split into two pieces.</p>

  <p>Below, we’ll discuss each of these sections of the RDE and how they
  work.</p>
  <h2><strong>Code Window</strong></h2>

  <p>The Code Window is the area in the upper-left portion of the screen:</p>

  <p><img style="width: 75%;" src="img/Code%20Window.png" alt=""></p>

  <p>At the top left side of the window are four clickable icons. To the right
  of those icons is the name of the file you're editing. Below the icons is the
  area where you write and edit your code.</p>

  <p>The four clickable icons are:</p>
  <table style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/play.png" alt=""></td>
        <td>

          <p>This is the “Play” icon. When you click this icon, your code will
          execute (also called "running your code").</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/folder.png" alt=""></td>
        <td>
          <p align="center">This is the “File” icon. When you click this icon,
          a list of files will pop up so that you can get back to code you have
          previously saved. The popup will look like this:</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;"><img style=
          "border: 1px solid; width: 300px;" alt="" src=
          "img/file_open.png"></p>

          <p>From this menu you can do three things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              <p>To create a new file, click on the “New File” bar</p>
            </li>
            <li>

              <p>To open a previously saved file, click on the file name of the
              file you’d like to open</p>
            </li>
            <li>

              <p>To change the name or to duplicate an existing file, click on
              the “Edit” icon to the right of the file you’d like to change</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/save.png" alt=""></td>
        <td>

          <p>This is the “Save” icon. When you click this icon, your code will
          be saved under the current file name. If you’d like to change the
          name of the file, use the “File” icon mentioned above.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/theme.png" alt=""></td>
        <td>

          <p>This is the “Settings” icon. When you click this icon, you will be
          prompted to change various settings or to shut down the RDE.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Note that by clicking the two arrows to the right of the filename, you can
  expand or collapse this window.</p>
  <h2><strong>Output Window</strong></h2>

  <p>Here is the window you should see in the lower-left portion of the
  screen:</p>

  <p><img style="width: 75%;" src="img/Program%20Output.png" alt=""></p>

  <p>This is called the Output Window. It is where your program will display
  information about the program status.</p>

  <p>For example, you may tell your program to print something to this area.
  Or, if your program has an error, the error would be displayed in this area.
  This area will also indicate if your program has finished running or you have
  stopped it.</p>
  <h2><strong>Projects &amp; Documentation Window</strong></h2>

  <p>On the right-hand side of the screen, you should see a window that
  resembles this:</p>

  <p><img style="border: 1px solid; width: 60%;" src="img/PG%20Window.jpg" alt=
  ""></p>

  <p>This is the Projects &amp; Documentation Window, and it consists of two
  parts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Navigation Menu</strong></p>

      <p>The Icon Menu consists of four clickable navigation icons, each of
      which serves a specific function. Let’s look at the four icons
      individually:</p>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/back.png" alt=""></td>
            <td>

              <p>Clicking the “Back” arrow will step you back through your
              viewing history.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/forward.png" alt=""></td>
            <td>

              <p>Clicking the “Forward” arrow will step you forward through
              your viewing history (if you had previously stepped
              backwards).</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/home.png" alt=""></td>
            <td>

              <p>The “Home” icon will take you to the home page list of all the
              projects (as seen in the example).</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 40px;" src="img/api.png" alt=""></td>
            <td>

              <p>The “API” icon will take you to the list of custom APIs (we'll
              discuss what that is later) available as part of the
              RaspberrySTEM.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Projects &amp; Documentation</strong></p>

      <p>Below the Navigation Menu is the view of the projects and
      documentation available as part of the RaspberrySTEM platform. Any parts
      of the documentation that are underlined in blue are clickable hyperlinks
      that will take you to other parts of the documentation or projects.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Now that you have a basic overview of the RDE, it’s time to write and run
  your first program. We call this Project #1, and like all the RaspberrySTEM
  Projects, it’s available in the Projects &amp; Documentation Window.</p>

  <p>To start working on Project #1, click the <strong><span style=
  "text-decoration: underline;">next</span></strong> link below...</p>
