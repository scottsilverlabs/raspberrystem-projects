<h1>INTRODUCTION TO THE IDE</h1>
<p>If you’re reading
this, you’ve successfully built your RaspberrySTEM, have connected
it to the monitor and have loaded your Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) – you’re now ready to get started!</p>
<p>Here is (generally)
what this IDE should look like:</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_886f87a.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="416" width="665"></p>
<p>The first thing
you’ll likely notice is that the screen is split down the middle,
with the left side in blue and the right side in white (you’re
probably reading this on the right-hand side of the screen right
now).  The left (blue) side is also split into two pieces.  
</p>
<p>Below, we’ll
discuss each of these three sections of the IDE and how they work.</p>
<h2>
<b>Code Window</b></h2>
<p>Here is the window
you should see in the upper-left portion of the screen:</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m381930ce.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="250" width="713"></p>
<p>This is the Code
Window and it consists of three parts:<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>Icon Menu</b></li></ol>

<p>The Icon Menu
consists of four clickable icons, each of which serves a specific
function.  Let’s look at the four icons individually:</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m237c23ed.png" align="left" border="0" height="52" hspace="14" width="43"></p>
<p>This is the “Play”
icon.  When you click this icon, the code in the Code Area will
execute.<br><br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_aa2ced4.png" align="left" border="0" height="53" hspace="14" width="62"></p>
<p align="center">This is the “File”
icon.  When you click this icon, a list of files will pop up so that
you can get back to code you have previously saved.  The popup will
look like this:</p><p align="center"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m2fe9f360.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="283" width="381"></p>
<p></p><p>From this menu you
can do three things:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>
	To create a new file, click on the “New File” bar</p>
	</li><li><p>
	To open a previously saved file, click on the file name of the file
	you’d like to open</p>
	</li><li><p>
	To change the name or to duplicate an existing file, click on the
	“Edit” icon to the right of the file you’d like to change</p>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><br><br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m293a950d.png" align="left" border="0" height="49" hspace="14" width="53">This is the “Save”
icon.  When you click this icon, the code in the Code Area will be
saved under the current file name.  If you’d like to change the
name of the file, use the “File” icon mentioned above.</p><p></p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_661c5b10.png" align="left" border="0" height="51" hspace="14" width="53">This is the
“Settings” icon.  When you click this icon, you will be prompted
to change various settings or to shut down the IDE.</p><p><b></b></p><ol start="2"><li><b>File Name</b></li></ol>

<p>To the right of the
Icon Menu is an indication of the file that is currently being edited
in the Code Area.  Here is an enlargement of the example above:</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m285f895c.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="84" width="374"></p>
<p>In this example
above, you can see that the file being edited is called,
“Unititled.py”  This is the default file when you first open the
IDE, and the “.py” at the end of the filename denotes that the
code stored in the file is written in the programming language
Python.</p>
<p>Note that by
clicking the two arrows to the right of the filename, you can expand
or collapse this window.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><p>
	<b>Code Area</b></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Below the Icon Menu
and Filename is the area where you write and edit your code.  In the
example above, the code in this window looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_524489da.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="94" width="391"></p>
<p>In this example,
there is only one line of code.  Note that the lines are numbered to
make finding/referencing a particular line easier.  
</p>
<h2><b>Output Window</b></h2>
<p>Here is the window
you should see in the lower-left portion of the screen:</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_60f60d41.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="131" width="721"></p>
<p>This is called the
Output Window is there is where your program will display various
pieces of information.</p>
<p>For example, you
make tell your program to print something to this area.  Or, if your
program has an error, the error would be displayed in this area. 
This area will also indicate if your program is finished running or
you have stopped it.</p><p></p>
<h2><b>Projects &amp;
Documentation Window</b></h2>
<p>On the right-hand
side of the screen, you should see a window that resembles this:</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_662bccf4.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="479" width="692"></p>
<p>This is the Projects
&amp; Documentation Window, and it consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>
	<b>Navigation Menu</b></p>
</li></ol>
<p>The Icon Menu
consists of four clickable navigation icons, each of which serves a
specific function.  Let’s look at the four icons individually:</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m59f088a0.png" align="left" border="0" height="47" hspace="14" width="55">Clicking the
“Previous” arrow will step you back through your viewing history.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m71ad0213.png" align="left" border="0" height="52" hspace="14" width="56">Clicking the
“Forward” arrow will step you forward through your viewing
history (if you had previously stepped backwards).</p><p></p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m33e91d22.png" align="left" border="0" height="47" hspace="14" width="56">The “Home” icon
will take you to the home page list of all the projects (as seen in
the example).</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_38255915.png" align="left" border="0" height="51" hspace="14" width="53">The “API” icon
will take you to the list of custom APIs (functions) available as
part of the RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<p><br><br>
</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p>
	<b>Projects &amp; Documentation</b></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Below the Navigation
Menu is the view of the projects and documentation available as part
of the RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup> platform.  Any parts of the
documentation that are underlined in blue are clickable hyperlinks
that will take you to other parts of the documentation or projects.</p>
<p>Now that you have a
basic overview of the IDE, it’s time to write and run your first
program.  We call this Project #1, and like all the RaspberrySTEM<sup>TM</sup>
projects, it’s available in the Projects &amp; Documentation
Window.  
</p>
<p>To view Project #1,
do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>
	<b>Click the “Home” Icon in the Projects &amp; Documentation
	Navigation Menu</b></p>
	</li><li><p>
	<b>Click on “Project #1: Your First Program”</b></p>
</li></ol>
