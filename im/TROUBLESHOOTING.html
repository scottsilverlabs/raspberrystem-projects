<h1>TROUBLESHOOTING CIRCUITS</h1>
<p>Wiring circuits, using electronic components and writing
software isn't easy -- even professionals spend a lot of time
"debugging" their hardware and software designs. &nbsp;So, if
you're having issues, don't feel bad, it's a typical part of any
programming and electronics work you'll ever do. &nbsp;Below, we
offer some suggestions on how to work through the issues you might be
having with your projects. &nbsp;If you're having issues that
aren't addressed in any of the sections below, feel free to visit our
support page at: <a href="http://www.raspberrystem.com/support">http://www.raspberrystem.com/support</a>.</p>
<h2>CIRCUIT ISSUES</h2>
<p>If&nbsp;your circuit isn't working, there are lots of
potential issues you could be encountering.&nbsp; When this
happens, the best approach is one that tests each part of the circuit
piece-by-piece until the problem is identified and fixed.
&nbsp;The process involves starting at the very beginning (the
Raspberry Pi computer), working our way up to the breadboard, examining
each of the components to ensure they've been placed/wired correctly
and then testing for continuity around the entire circuit.</p>
<p>Here
is a step-by-step checklist that you can use to efficiently test your
circuit&nbsp;to resolve issues. &nbsp;After following these
troubleshooting steps a few times, you'll start to get a hang of how to
resolve issues even more quickly on your own:<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">1. &nbsp;Verify that the
Raspberry Pi computer is receiving power</p>
<p>The first step is that you want to ensure that the Raspberry
Pi computer is powered on. &nbsp;This is very easy to verify --
just look to ensure that the red light on the front of the Raspberry Pi
is illuminated, as follows:</p>
<p><img style="width: 392px; height: 220px;" alt="" src="img/pi_led.jpg"></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>If the light on the Raspberry Pi is not illuminated, you'll
want to check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Verify that the Raspberry Pi power supply is plugged into
a working wall outlet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the Raspberry Pi power supply is correctly
plugged into the Raspberry Pi computer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2. &nbsp;Verify that the
connector board is being powered correctly</p>
<p>Now that we're confident that the Raspberry Pi is powered on,
we want to ensure that it is correctly connected to the Lid Connector
Board with the Ribbon Cable. &nbsp;To verify this, do the following<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take a working LED and place the longer metal lead in one
of the holes marked "3.3V" on the Lid Connector Board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the shorter metal lead of that LED and place it in
one of the holes marked "GND" on the Lid Connector Board</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the LED should be illuminated, as follows:</p>
<p> PIC OF LED IN LID CONNECTOR</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
&nbsp;Don't leave the LED like that for very long, as without a
resistor, the LED can be damaged.</p>
<p>If the LED is not illuminated, you'll want to check the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Verify that the Ribbon Cable is fully inserted onto the
Raspberry Pi, with the connector nearly flush with the bottom of the
pins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the Ribbon Cable is fully inserted into the
back of the Lid Connector Board, with the connector nearly flush with
the lid</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Verify that the
breadboard is being powered and grounded
correctly</p>
<p>Assuming the Lid Connector Board is receiving power, the next
thing you'll want to verify is that your breadboard is
receiving power and ground correctly. &nbsp;We will assume that you
already have a wire running&nbsp;from&nbsp;a hole marked "3.3V"
in the Lid Connector Board to a hole along the red strip of the
Breadboard and that you already have a wire running&nbsp;from a
hole marked "GND" in the Lid Connector Board to a hole along the blue
strip of the Breadboard.</p>
<p>To verify that the breadboard is correctly receiving power, do
the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take a working LED, and place the longer metal lead of the
LED
somewhere along the red (power) strip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the shorter metal lead
of the LED and place it somewhere along the blue (ground) strip.
&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the power and ground strips on the breadboard are working
correctly, the LED should illuminate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is
an example:</p>
<p>INSERT FRITZING OF LED ACROSS POWER/GROUND</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
&nbsp;Don't leave the LED like that for very long, as without a
resistor, the LED can be damaged.</p>
<p>If the LED is not illuminated, you'll want to check to ensure
that 3.3V is connected to the red strip and GND is connected to the
blue strip. &nbsp;There is nothing stopping you from (purposefully
or
accidentally) wiring it backwards, with red strip being wired to GND
and
blue being wired to 3.3V. &nbsp;But, if you do this, the red strip
will become the ground and the blue strip will become the power.
&nbsp;Then, all of your components will need to be wired with that
convention.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">4. &nbsp;Check that each
component is being wired and
programmed correctly</p>
<p>Once you are confident that your breadboard is being powered
and grounded correctly, the next step is to verify that each of your
components is wired correctly and functioning properly. &nbsp;We
have included sections below to troubleshoot each of the components
provided with the RaspberrySTEM kit. &nbsp;Here are links to
troubleshoot each of the individual components:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;LED</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Button</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Accelerometer</p>
<p>- &nbsp;LED Matrix<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Test continuity between various points in the
circuit</p>
<p>If you've verified power and ground are working correctly, and
you've verified that each of your components are wire correctly and
functioning correctly, but your circuit still isn't working, it time to
do some investigation into whether the wiring between components was
done correctly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Verify your code is working as expected</p>
<p></p>
<h2>LED ISSUES</h2>
<p>LEDs are relatively simple devices, but there are still some
challenges you'll face when using them in your circuits.
&nbsp;Luckily, fixing LED issues should be pretty quick and easy
once you get used to working with them. &nbsp;Here are some tips on
how to solve issues with LEDs:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. &nbsp;Verify that
the LED is working properly</span></p>
<p>Assuming you have a verified power source (either the battery
used in the "Your First Circuit" project or the Lid Connector Board),
you can place the LED with the long lead attached to power and the
short lead attached to ground, and verify that it illuminates.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
&nbsp;Don't leave the LED like that for very long, as without a
resistor, the LED can be damaged.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.
&nbsp;Verify that the LED is oriented correctly</span><br>
</p>
<p>If the LED isn't working with a verified power source, you
should ensure that the LED is oriented correctly, with the longer lead
attached to the power and the shorter lead attached to ground.
&nbsp;To be certain that the LED is oriented correctly, you can
always try turning it so that the leads attach the other way and see if
it works that way. &nbsp;If the LED doesn't work in either
direction, there is a good chance that your LED isn't functional.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">3. &nbsp;If attached to
a GPIO, verify that the LED is wired
correctly</p>
<p>If you are attempting to attach an LED to GPIO, you'll want to
ensure that the longer lead is attached to power and that the shorter
lead is attached to the GPIO, as follows (in this example, we're using
GPIO14):</p>
<p><img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_GPIO_bb.png"></p>
<p> <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. &nbsp;If attached
to a GPIO, verify that the code reflects the
correct GPIO being used</span></p>
<p>Once you have verified that the LED is working correctly and
that it is correctly wired, you can use the following short piece of
code to verify that the LED is wired correctly (note that the code reflects using GPIO14 for the LED):</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>from rstem.gpio import Output
my_led = Output(14)
my_led.on()
</textarea></div>
<p></p>
<h2>BUTTON ISSUES</h2>
<p>1. &nbsp;Verify that the button is oriented correctly on
the breadboard</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Ensure the button is fully inserted into the
breadboard</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;If attached to a GPIO, verify that the button is
wired correctly</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;If attached to a GPIO, verify that the code
reflects the correct GPIO being used</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;If still not working, you might want to verify
that the button works correctly (unlikely issue)</p>
<h2>ACCELEROMETER ISSUES</h2>
<p>1. &nbsp;If you see or smell smoke, verify that the
accelerometer is oriented correctly</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Ensure that the accelerometer is wired correctly</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Test the accelerometer with some simple code</p>
<h2>LED MATRIX ISSUES</h2>
<p>1. &nbsp;Verify that your LED Matrix cable is installed
correctly &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Verify that your display is oriented correctly on
the circuit board</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Ensure that the LED Matrix is wired correctly</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Test the LED Matrix with some simple code</p>
