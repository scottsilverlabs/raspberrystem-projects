<h1>TROUBLESHOOTING</h1>
<p>Wiring circuits, using electronic components and writing
software isn't easy -- even professionals spend a lot of time
"debugging" their hardware and software designs. &nbsp;So, if
you're having issues, don't feel bad, it's a typical part of an
programming and electronics work you'll ever do. &nbsp;Below, we
offer some suggestions on how to work through the issues you might be
having with your projects. &nbsp;If you're having issues that
aren't addressed in any of the sections below, feel free to visit our
support page at: <a href="http://www.raspberrystem.com/support">http://www.raspberrystem.com/support</a>.</p>
<h2>CIRCUIT ISSUES</h2>
<p>If&nbsp;your circuit isn't working, there are lots of
potential issues you could be encountering.&nbsp; When this
happens, the best approach is one that tests each part of the circuit
piece-by-piece until the problem is identified and fixed.
&nbsp;Here are some suggestions on how to do this in an efficient
fashion:<br>
<br>
1. &nbsp;Verify that the circuit is being powered and grounded
correctly</p>
<p>The first thing you'll want to verify is that your circuit is
receiving power and ground. &nbsp;Most likely, you're providing
power and ground to the breadboard from the lid connector, and you're
using the red and blue power/ground strips to provide power and ground
to the rest of the breadboard. &nbsp;Assuming this is the case,
testing to ensure power and ground are working should be pretty simple.</p>
<p>Take a working LED, and place the longer lead of the LED
somewhere along the power strip. &nbsp;Next, take the shorter lead
of the LED and place it somewhere along the ground strip.
&nbsp;You've now created a simple circuit using power, ground and
an LED -- if the power and ground are working correctly, and if the LED
is placed in this fashion, the LED should illuminate. &nbsp;Here is
an example:</p>
<p>INSERT FRITZING OF LED ACROSS POWER/GROUND</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
&nbsp;Don't leave the LED like that for very long, as without a
resistor, the LED can be damaged.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Verify that power and ground are not reversed</p>
<p>By convention, the red power strip is typically used for power
and the blue power strip is typically used for ground. &nbsp;Like
this:</p>
<p>INSERT FRITZING OF TYPICAL POWER/GROUND</p>
<p>But, there is nothing stopping you from (purposefully or
accidentally) wiring it backwards, with red being used for ground and
blue being used for power. &nbsp;Like this:</p>
<p>INSERT FRITZING OF BACKWARDS POWER/GROUND</p>
<p>The previous wiring would still work, but would require that
you&nbsp;provide power to your circuit from the blue rail and
ground from the red rail (opposite of typical convention).</p>
<p>If your circuit isn't working, verify that your circuit is
getting power from the powered rail and ground from the grounded rail,
and that you haven't accidentally switched power and ground coming onto
your breadboard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Check that each component is being wired and
programmed correctly.</p>
<p>Once you are confident that your circuit is getting working
power and ground, the next step is to verify that each of your
components is wired correctly and functioning properly. &nbsp;We
have included sections below to troubleshoot each of the components
provided with the RaspberrySTEM kit. &nbsp;Here are links to
troubleshoot each of the individual components:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;LED</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Button</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Accelerometer</p>
<p>- &nbsp;LED Matrix<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Test continuity between various points in the
circuit</p>
<p>If you've verified power and ground are working correctly, and
you've verified that each of your components are wire correctly and
functioning correctly, but your circuit still isn't working, it time to
do some investigation into whether the wiring between components was
done correctly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Verify your code is working as expected</p>
<p></p>
<h2>LED ISSUES</h2>
<p>LEDs are relatively simple devices, but there are still some
challenges you'll face when using them in your circuits.
&nbsp;Luckily, fixing LED issues should be pretty quick and easy
once you get used to working with them. &nbsp;Here are some tips on
how to solve issues with LEDs:<br>
<br>
1. &nbsp;Verify that the LED is working properly<br>
<br>
2. &nbsp;Verify that the LED is oriented correctly<br>
<br>
3. &nbsp;If attached to a GPIO, verify that the LED is wired
correctly<br>
<br>
4. &nbsp;If attached to a GPIO, verify that the code reflects the
correct GPIO being used</p>
<h2>BUTTON ISSUES</h2>
<p>1. &nbsp;Verify that the button is oriented correctly on
the breadboard</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Ensure the button is fully inserted into the
breadboard</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;If attached to a GPIO, verify that the button is
wired correctly</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;If attached to a GPIO, verify that the code
reflects the correct GPIO being used</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;If still not working, you might want to verify
that the button works correctly (unlikely issue)</p>
<h2>ACCELEROMETER ISSUES</h2>
<p>1. &nbsp;If you see or smell smoke, verify that the
accelerometer is oriented correctly</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Ensure that the accelerometer is wired correctly</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Test the accelerometer with some simple code</p>
<h2>LED MATRIX ISSUES</h2>
<p>1. &nbsp;Verify that your display is oriented correctly on
the circuit board</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Ensure that the LED Matrix is wired correctly</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Test the LED Matrix with some simple code</p>
