<h1>BOUNCING BALL 1</h1>
<p>In our previous project, <a href="GAME_LOOPS.html">Game
Loops</a>, we discussed the general format of a game
loop, and we implemented a game loop that moved a dot across the LED
Matrix display. &nbsp;For the next few projects, we're going to
modify
that game loop to incorporate some more features; these will help
explain how we can use the LED Matrix display for some more interesting
games that we'll introduce in a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this project,
we're going to modify the game loop to provide some testing of the
location of the dot to determine when it comes to the edge of the
display. &nbsp;When it does, we will reverse direction of the dot
so
that it never falls off the screen.</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Tracking
Direction</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Here's a
reminder of what our current code looks like:</span></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Initialize the game environment
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

fb = FrameBuffer()
x, y = (1, 1)
fb.erase()

while True:
	# Get user input

	# Update the game world
	x += 1

	# Draw graphics on the screen
	fb.erase()
	fb.point(x, y)
	fb.show()

	# Wait for some period of time
	time.sleep(.5)

# Finish & Cleanup
</textarea></div>
<p class="MsoNormal">You'll
notice that on Line 13, we increment (increase) x by 1 to move the dot
to the right on the display. &nbsp;This works great...until we get
to
the edge of the screen and we don't want to go any further.
&nbsp;At
that point, we're going to want the dot to move in the OPPOSITE
direction (in this case, to the left). &nbsp;To do that, instead of
incrementing x by 1, we're going to want to decrement (decrease) x by
1. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In other words, to go to the right,
we increase x by 1. &nbsp;And to go to the left, we decrease x by 1
--
which is the same as increasing x by -1. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We
can do this by creating a variable (let's call it "direction"), setting
that variable to either 1 or -1 (depending on the direction we want the
dot to go) and then increasing x by that variable. &nbsp;When
direction
is set to 1, the ball will move right; when direction is set to -1, the
ball will move left.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This will require two changes to our
code. &nbsp;First, Line 13 will change to:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
x += direction
</textarea></div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next,
because the variable direction hasn't yet been set to anything (which
would break our program), we need to initialize that variable before we
jump into our loop. &nbsp;Since we want the ball to move right at
first, we can initally set the variable equal to 1. &nbsp;We can do
that by adding the following line to our initialization code:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
direction = 1
</textarea></div>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you now run this code, you'll
see that things work exactly the way they did in the last project --
the dot moves to the right and then disappears from the screen.
&nbsp;We're now tracking the dots direction, but we haven't done
anything to test
for when it gets to the edge of the display or to change direction when
that happens.</p>
<h2>Testing Location</h2>
<p>When
the program starts, the first position of the dot is x = 1.
&nbsp;Each
time through the loop, we increment x by 1. &nbsp;So, after the
first
loop, the position of the dot moves to x = 2. &nbsp;After the next
loop, the dot moves to x = 3. &nbsp;And so on...<br>
<br>
We know that
the LED Matrix display is 8 dots wide, so when x = 9, it will disappear
from the screen. &nbsp;In order to keep the dot from disappearing
from
the screen, we need to know when x = 8 (or more than 8) and we need to
reverse the direction of movement before the next time through the
loop. &nbsp;We can check the value of x (which is the same as
checking
the position of the dot) using an IF statement, and if we determine
that we're at the edge of the screen, we can change the direction of
the dot by switching direction from 1 to -1:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
if (x >= 7):
	direction = -1
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">If
you insert this code at any point after&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">x += direction</span><span style=""> and run the program, you'll see that the
ball gets to the right of the display and then -- before disappearing
-- reverses direction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">But,
you'll probably notice that, after heading back to where it started, it
falls off the other side of the screen!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Whoops.
&nbsp;We checked to ensure that the ball didn't fall off the screen
when x got too big (too far right), but we didn't check for when x got
too small (too far left). &nbsp;Luckily, this is pretty easy to add
to
our code...we can just update the IF statement we just wrote as follows:</span></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
if (x >= 7) or (x <= 0):
	direction = -direction
</textarea></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> This
checks whether x is too big (greater than or equal to 8) or whether x
is too small (less than or equal to 1) -- in either of those cases, we
need to change direction. Notice that we also changed the
line
handling the direction&nbsp;as well -- this reverses the direction
from&nbsp;</span><span style="">
whatever it previously was.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Give it a
try. &nbsp;You should now see the dot boucing back and forth on the
display.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Here is the final code:</span></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Initialize the game environment
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

fb = FrameBuffer()
x, y = (1, 1)
fb.erase()

direction = 1

while True:
	# Get user input

	# Update the game world
	x += direction
	if (x <= 0) or (x >= 7):
		direction = -direction

	# Draw graphics on the screen
	fb.erase()
	fb.point(x, y)
	fb.show()

	# Wait for some period of time
	time.sleep(.5)

# Finish & Cleanup
