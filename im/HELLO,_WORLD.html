<h1>HELLO, WORLD!</h1>

<p>Start with
introduction to programming…</p>

<p>It’s customary in
the programming world that the very first program you write is
called, “Hello, World!” The purpose of this program is simple –
have the computer print the words, “Hello, World!” on the screen. </p>

<p>We’re not ones to
buck tradition, so we’re going to make “Hello, World!” our very
first project. The nice thing about this project is that it’s easy
to do (it’s only one line of code) and it will give us an
opportunity to start exploring our Integrated Development Environment
(IDE).</p>

<p>Here are step-by-by
instructions for implementing this project; after we’ve completed
it, we’ll talk more about how and why it works.</p>

<h2>Step #1: Find the Code Window on Your IDE</h2>

<p>All the code you
will be writing as part of the RaspberrySTEM projects will be done
within the IDE. Specifically, you’ll be writing your code in the
Code Window portion of the IDE. As a reminder, here is the Code Window
in the IDE:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_7992f68b.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="402" width="643"></p>

<p>You’ll notice that
at the top left corner of the Code Window, there is a line numbered
“1”. This is where you will type in your program’s code:<!--I think we should eliminate the "<-- Enter your code Starting here", and from here on out, use "code block" HTML.  This first code block will have to note that files willby default start with "import rstem" because we'l  be using it in most all of our programs.--></p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>import rstem
</textarea></div>

<h2><br>
</h2>

<h2>Step #2: Enter Your Code in The Code Window</h2>

<p>On line 2 of the
Code Window, type the following:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="2">
<div> </div><textarea>print('Hello, World!')
</textarea></div>

<p>When you are
finished typing that line, press &lt;ENTER&gt; and you should see a
prompt for line 2 in your window.</p>

<p>Your code window
should now look like this:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>import rstem
print('Hello, World!')
</textarea></div>

<p><b>Note: </b>It’s
important to note that capitalization generally does matter when
you’re programming. In this line of code, if the word “print”
isn’t in all lowercase letters, you may find that your code doesn’t
work as expected.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>
Instead of typing that command, you can cut-and-paste it from right
here in this document. To do that, highlight the line above using
your mouse…<!--needs completion - or remove.--></p>

<h2>Step #3: Run Your Code</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve
typed (or cut-and-pasted) the line of code into the Code Window,
let’s see if it works. We do this by “running” the program. To run the
program, click on the Play icon (<img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" alt="" src="img/play.png" align="top">) in the Title Bar.<br>
</p>

<p>The program runs by
starting at the first line, doing what that line says (“executing”
that line), and then moving on to the next line. It does that until
it reaches the bottom.<!--Need note about import line--> In this case,
we only have one line, so only
that line of code is executed.</p>

<h2>Step #4: Verify the “Output” of Your Code</h2>

<p>If you’ve done
everything correctly, you should see the following in your Output
Window (the window in the lower left of the IDE, below the Code
Window):</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_70568b2c.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="167" width="612"><!--Use program output HTML--></p>

<p>The first line of
the output window is the result of the code you’ve written –
you’ve successfully had the computer print the words “Hello,
World!”</p>

<p>The second line
indicates that the program is finished running – this will be
important later when you’re writing longer and more complicated
programs.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve just written your first program!</p>

<p><b>But wait! What
if the output from your program doesn’t look like it’s supposed
to?</b> </p>

<p>This will happen
when you’ve made a mistake typing in your program. </p>

<p>Don’t worry, this
happens to all of us at some point or another – you may have made a
little mistake (like misspelling a word) or you may have made a
bigger mistake. Luckily, with this first program, we should be able
to figure out pretty easily where the mistake is.</p>

<p>Let’s discuss
where the common mistakes might be in your program, and once you
think you have them fixed, go ahead and click the Play icon again to
have the computer run the program another time.</p>

<p><b>Common Mistake
#1: Capitalization is Important</b></p>

<p>The most common
mistake is not capitalize words in your program correctly. In this
case, the word “print” is a command word (it tells the computer
to do something), and it needs to be all lowercase. Verify that you
haven’t capitalized any of the letters in the word “print”. </p>

<p><b>Common Mistake
#2: Not Using Parentheses – “(” and “)” – Correctly</b></p>

<p>If you’ve checked
your capitalization and that wasn’t the problem, next verify that
you have parentheses around the “Hello, World!” part of your
code.</p>

<p><b>Common Mistake
#3: Not Using Quotation Marks (‘ ’) – Correctly</b></p>

<p>If your
capitalization is correct and you’ve used the parentheses
correctly, the next thing to check is that you’ve correctly put
quotation marks around “Hello, World!” It doesn’t matter if
you’ve chosen to use single quotation marks (‘) or double
quotation marks (“), as long as you have the same on both sides.<br>
