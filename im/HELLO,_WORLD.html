<h1>HELLO, WORLD!</h1><p>It’s customary in
the programming world that the very first program you write is
called, “Hello, World!” The purpose of this program is simple –
have the computer print the words, “Hello, World!” on the screen. </p>
<p>We’re not ones to
buck tradition, so we’re going to make “Hello, World!” our very
first project. The nice thing about this project is that it’s easy
to do (it’s only one line of code) and it will give us an
opportunity to start exploring our Integrated Development Environment
(IDE).</p>
<p>Here are step-by-by
instructions for implementing this project; after we’ve completed
it, we’ll talk more about how and why it works.</p>
<h2>Step #1: Find the Code Window on Your IDE</h2>
<p>All the code you
will be writing as part of the RaspberrySTEM projects will be done
within the IDE. Specifically, you’ll be writing your code in the
Code Window portion of the IDE, which we discussed in the User Guide.
As a reminder, here is the Code Window in the IDE:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_7992f68b.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="402" width="643"></p>
<p>You’ll notice that
at the top left corner of the Code Window, there is a line numbered
“1”. This is where you will type in your program’s code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_88e55b8.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="185" width="624"></p>
<h2>Step #2: Enter Your Code in The Code Window</h2>
<p>On line 1 of the
Code Window, type the following:</p>
<div class="code">
print (‘Hello, World!’)
</div>
<p>When you are
finished typing that line, press &lt;ENTER&gt; and you should
see a
prompt for line 2 in your window.</p>
<p>Your code window
should now look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_524489da.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="153" width="636"></p>
<p><b>Note: </b>In future projects, we will not be
showing pictures of the code window like we've done here. &nbsp;All
code will be presented in "code boxes" like the one you see above.
&nbsp;In some cases, the code box will indicate line numbers to
make it easier to ensure that your code is identical to ours; in some
cases, we'll leave out line numbers to avoid confusion -- this is
typically when we're adding new code to existing code and we can't be
sure our line numbers will be the same as yours.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>It’s
important to note that capitalization generally does matter when
you’re programming. In this line of code, if the word “print”
isn’t in all lowercase letters, you may find that your code doesn’t
work as expected.</p><p><b>Note: </b>
We mentioned in the Projects Guide introduction that there's a way to
cut-and-paste code instead of typing it all in. &nbsp;As an example of
how you do this, you can cut-and-paste the line above right into your
code window. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Highlight the print ('Hello, World!') line in the code box
above using
your mouse</p>
</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the &lt;CTRL&gt; character on your
keyboard and press the letter &lt;C&gt; at the same time</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click in the Code Window where you want to paste the code</p>
</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the &lt;CRTL&gt; character on your
keyboard and press the letter &lt;V&gt; at the same time</p>
</li></ol>
<h2></h2><h2>Step #3: Run Your Code</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve
typed (or cut-and-pasted) the line of code into the Code Window,
let’s see if it works. We do this by “running” the program. To run the
program, click on the Play icon in the Icon menu
(highlighted in Yellow here):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m18c278ea.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="204" width="626"></p>
<p>Click the Play icon
now.</p>
<p>The program runs by
starting at the first line, doing what that line says (“executing”
that line), and then moving on to the next line. It does that until
it reaches the bottom. In this case, we only have one line, so only
that line of code is executed.</p>
<h2>Step #4: Verify the “Output” of Your Code</h2>
<p>If you’ve done
everything correctly, you should see the following in your Output
Window (the window in the lower left of the IDE, below the Code
Window):</p>
<div class="output">
Hello, World!
</div>
<p>The first line of
the output window is the result of the code you’ve written –
you’ve successfully had the computer print the words “Hello,
World!”</p>
<p>The second line, which should say "Program Finished,"
indicates that the program is finished running – this will be
important later when you’re writing longer and more complicated
programs.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve just written your first program!</p>
<p><b>But wait! What
if the output from your program doesn’t look like it’s supposed
to?</b> </p>
<p>This will happen
when you’ve made a mistake typing in your program. </p>
<p>Don’t worry, this
happens to all of us at some point or another – you may have made a
little mistake (like misspelling a word) or you may have made a
bigger mistake. Luckily, with this first program, we should be able
to figure out pretty easily where the mistake is.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss
where the common mistakes might be in your program, and once you
think you have them fixed, go ahead and click the Play icon again to
have the computer run the program another time.</p>
<p><b>Common Mistake
#1: Capitalization is Important</b></p>
<p>The most common
mistake is not capitalize words in your program correctly. In this
case, the word “print” is a command word (it tells the computer
to do something), and it needs to be all lowercase. Verify that you
haven’t capitalized any of the letters in the word “print”. </p>
<p><b>Common Mistake
#2: Not Using Parentheses – “(” and “)” – Correctly</b></p>
<p>If you’ve checked
your capitalization and that wasn’t the problem, next verify that
you have parentheses around the “Hello, World!” part of your
code.</p>
<p><b>Common Mistake
#3: Not Using Quotation Marks (‘ ’) – Correctly</b></p>
<p>If your
capitalization is correct and you’ve used the parentheses
correctly, the next thing to check is that you’ve correctly put
quotation marks around “Hello, World!” It doesn’t matter if
you’ve chosen to use single quotation marks (‘) or double
quotation marks (“), as long as you have the same on both sides.</p>
