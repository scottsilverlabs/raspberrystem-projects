      In this project, we'll write our first code.

  <p>It’s customary in the programming world that the very first program you
  write is called, “Hello, World!” The purpose of this program is simple – have
  the computer print the words, “Hello, World!” on the screen.</p>

  <p>We’re not ones to buck tradition, so we’re going to make “Hello, World!”
  our very first project. The nice thing about this project is that it’s easy
  to do (it’s only one line of code) and it will give us an opportunity to
  start exploring our RaspberrySTEM Development Environment (RDE).</p>

      What is Programming?
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to
      follow. You write these instructions using an editing tool (we provide a
      custom editing tool as part of the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit) and then
      "send" those instructions to the the computer to carry out (or
      "execute"). Just like there are lots of different languages that people
      can speak, there are also many languages that computer instructions can
      be written in -- each of which will ultimately be converted into a format
      that the computer understands.</p>

      <p>The RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit supports many different programming
      languages, but we will primarily be focused on one of the most common,
      called Python. Python is a versatile language that is used in both the
      academic and the professional world to build a varied set of applications
      and tools. Learning how to program in the Python programming language
      will provide a solid foundation for all future programming education.</p>

  <div class="section" id="sw">
  <p>Here are step-by-by instructions for implementing this project; after
  we’ve completed it, we’ll talk more about how and why it works.</p>

  <h3 class=step>Enter Your Code in The Code Window</h3>

  <p>It's now time to enter the code for this project. In the Code Window,
  enter the following:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
print("Hello, World!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>A few things worth noting at this point:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>The line number "1" will automatically be visible before you start
      entering your code.  In future projects, we'll only include line numbers in the code boxes
      when it makes it easier to disucss specific lines of code.
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Capitalization generally DOES matter when you’re programming. In this
      line of code, if the word “print” isn’t in all lowercase letters, you may
      find that your code doesn’t work as expected.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>It's possible to cut-and-paste code into the Code Window instead of typing it all in. As an
      example of how you do this, you can cut-and-paste the line above right
      into your code window. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>

          <p>Highlight the <code>print('Hello, World!')</code> line in the code box above
          using your mouse</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Press and hold the &lt;CTRL&gt; key on your keyboard and press the
          letter "C" at the same time -- this copies your text</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Click in the Code Window where you want to paste the code</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Press and hold the &lt;CTRL&gt; key on your keyboard and press the
          letter "V" at the same time -- this pastes the text</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class=step>Run Your Code</h3>

  <p>Now that you’ve typed (or cut-and-pasted) the line of code into the Code
  Window, let’s see if it works. We do this by “running” the program. To run
  the program, click on the Play icon (<img class="inline_icon" alt="" src=
  "img/play.png">) at the top of the Code Window.</p>

  <p>The program runs by starting at the first line, doing what that line says
  (“executing” that line), and then moving on to the next line. It does that
  until it reaches the bottom. In this case, we only have one line, so only
  that line of code is executed.</p>

  <p>It may take a few seconds for the code to run, and you may notice two
  things during this time:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>The triangular PLAY icon turns to a square; and</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>That the little RaspberrySTEM icon at the top of the code window
      spins.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>These are just indications that the Raspberry Pi is busy running your
  code. And don't worry if you don't notice these things -- sometimes they
  happen so fast they they're not very noticeable.</p>
  <h3 class=step>Verify the “Output” of Your Code</h3>

  <p>If you’ve done everything correctly, you should see the following in your
  Program Output window (the window in the lower left of the RDE, below the Code
  Window):</p>
  <div class="output">
    <pre>
Hello, World!
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The first line of the output window is the result of the code you’ve
  written – you’ve successfully had the computer print the words “Hello,
  World!”</p>

  <p>The last line indicates that the program is finished running – this will
  be helpful later when you’re writing longer and more complicated
  programs.</p>

  <p><strong>Congratulations! You’ve just written your first program!</strong></p>

  <p>But wait! What if the output from your program doesn't look like it's
  supposed to? Or if you get a jumbled red and black error-looking message in
  the Program Output window? If that's the case, you likely have an error in your code.
  But, even if your code worked perfectly and you didn't get any errors in your
  code above, we highly recommend reading the next section, as you're certain
  to encounter programming errors at some point:</p>

  <p>We'll go over more ways to handle errors next in <a data-uid="errors"></a>.

  </div>
  <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>We picked <code>Hello, World!</code> as the text to print - why not try something else?
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Write a program to print multiple lines of text.  For example, a joke:
          <div class="output">
    <pre>
Q: How many programmers does it take 
   to change a light bulb?
A: None, that's a hardware problem.
</pre>
  </div>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Write some code that DOESN'T work - that is, that generates an error message.  Examine
      the error message to see where your code failed.
    </li>
  </ol>
