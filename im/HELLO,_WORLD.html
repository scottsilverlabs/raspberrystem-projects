<h1>HELLO, WORLD!</h1>
<p>It’s customary in
the programming world that the very first program you write is
called, “Hello, World!” The purpose of this program is simple –
have the computer print the words, “Hello, World!” on the screen. </p>
<p>We’re not ones to
buck tradition, so we’re going to make “Hello, World!” our very
first project. The nice thing about this project is that it’s easy
to do (it’s only one line of code) and it will give us an
opportunity to start exploring our RaspberrySTEM Development Environment
(RDE).</p>
<div class="info">
<div>What is Programming?</div>
<div>
<p>Programming is the process of writing instructions for a
computer to
follow. You write these instructions using an editing tool (we provide
a custom editing tool as part of the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, and then "send"
those instructions to the the computer to carry out (or "execute"). Just like
there are lots of different languages that people can speak, there are
also many languages that computer instructions
can be written in -- each of which will ultimately be converted into a
format that the computer understands.
</p>
<p>The RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit supports many different programming
languages, but we
will primarily be focused on one of the most common, called Python.
Python is a versatile language that is used in both the academic and
the professional world to build a varied set of applications and tools.
Learning how to program in the Python programming language will provide
a solid foundaiton for all future programming education.

<p>Here are step-by-by
instructions for implementing this project; after we’ve completed
it, we’ll talk more about how and why it works.</p><p></p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1: Find the Code Window on Your RDE</p><p>All the code you
will be writing as part of the RaspberrySTEM projects will be done
within the RDE. Specifically, you’ll be writing your code in the
Code Window portion of the RDE.
As a reminder, here is where the Code Window is located:</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid ; margin: auto; display: block; width: 80%;" alt="" src="img/This%20is%20the%20Code%20Window.jpg"></p>
<p>You’ll notice that
at the top left corner of the Code Window, there is a line numbered
“1”. This is where you will type in your program’s code:</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid ; margin: auto; display: block; width: 60%;" alt="" src="img/Enter%20Your%20Code.png"></p>
<p align="center"></p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2: Enter Your Code in The Code Window</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>It's now time to enter the code for this project. In
the code window, enter the following:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
print ("Hello, World!")
</textarea></div>
<p>A few things worth noting at this point:
<ul>
	<li><p>The line number "1" will automatically be visible
	before you start entering your code </p></li>
	<li><p>In future projects, the code boxes
we present may or may not indicate line numbers next to the lines of
code. Whenever possible, we'll include line numbers to
make it easier to ensure that your code is identical to ours; but, in
some
cases, we'll leave out line numbers to avoid confusion -- this is
typically when we're adding new code to existing code and we can't be
sure our line numbers will be the same as yours.</p></li>
<li><p>Capitalization generally DOES matter when
you’re programming. In this line of code, if the word “print”
isn’t in all lowercase letters, you may find that your code doesn’t
work as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>We mentioned in the Projects Guide introduction that there's a way to
cut-and-paste code instead of typing it all in. As an example
of
how you do this, you can cut-and-paste the line above right into your
code window. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Highlight the print ('Hello, World!') line in the code box
above using
your mouse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press and hold the &lt;CTRL&gt; key on your
keyboard and press the letter "C" at the same time --
this copies your text</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click in the Code Window where you want to paste the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press and hold the &lt;CTRL&gt; key on your
keyboard and press the letter "V" at the same time --
this pastes the text</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p></p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #3: Run Your Code</p><p>Now that you’ve
typed (or cut-and-pasted) the line of code into the Code Window,
let’s see if it works. We do this by “running” the program. To run the
program, click on the Play icon (<img style="width: 30px; vertical-align: middle;" alt="" src="img/play.png">)
at the top of the Code Window.</p>
<p>The program runs by
starting at the first line, doing what that line says (“executing”
that line), and then moving on to the next line. It does that until
it reaches the bottom. In this case, we only have one line, so only
that line of code is executed.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #4: Verify the “Output” of Your Code</p><p>If you’ve done
everything correctly, you should see the following in your Output
Window (the window in the lower left of the RDE, below the Code
Window):</p>

<div class="output">
<div></div>
<pre>Hello, World!<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The first line of
the output window is the result of the code you’ve written –
you’ve successfully had the computer print the words “Hello,
World!”</p>
<p>The last line
indicates that the program is finished running – this will be
helpful later when you’re writing longer and more complicated
programs.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve just written your first program!</p>
<p>But wait! What if the output from your program
doesn't look like it's supposed to? Or if you get a jumbled
red and black error-looking message in the Output Window? If
that's the case, you likely have an error in your code. But, even
if your code worked perfectly and you
didn't get any errors in your code above, we highly recommend reading
the next section, as you're certain to encounter programming
errors at some point:</p><p><a href="HANDLING_ERRORS.html">Click here to read about Handling Errors in Your Code...</a></p>
