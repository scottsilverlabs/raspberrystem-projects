<h1>SIMON 1</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">We've come a long way in the past several
projects, and we're now ready to build and program&nbsp;a
working pattern-matching game (similar to the electronic Simon game).
The game will require four different colored buttons (wired as GPIO
Inputs) and four LEDs (wired as GPIO Outputs). &nbsp;We'll also need
four resistors -- one for each LED we'll be wiring. &nbsp;We will
essentially be replicating the circuit designs that we learned in
previous projects, but on a larger scale. &nbsp;And we'll be writing
some longer and more complex code to handle all the game conditions.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Because the fully-built circuit will use up a lot of
breadboard space
and require a lot of wires, we highly recommend starting this project
with an empty breadboard, and implementing the circuit in a way that's
similar to the diagrams we provide. &nbsp;Also, you'll notice that
we wire
the buttons, LEDs and other components in a specific pattern (a square
or diamond shape) -- this will help make our game more playable when
it's complete.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In
this project, we'll wire up the four buttons and write some code to
verify they are working. &nbsp;In the next project, we'll wire up the
four LEDs and write some code to verify they are working. &nbsp;At that
point, the circuit is complete, and we'll spend several additional
projects building the code to make the game fully operating. &nbsp;Take your time, follow along, and pretty soon, you'll playing an electronic game that YOU built and programmed!</p><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware Implementation</span></h2><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware Step #1</span>: &nbsp;Provide Power to Both Power Rails</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Because
this circuit is going to be a bit larger than our previous circuits,
and because we're going to want to organize our components in a way
that we can actually use them later, we're going to make both power
rails (the red and blue strips on either side of the board) available.
&nbsp;As we've done previously, we make one set of power rails
functional by running wires from one of the 3.3V pins and one of the
GND pins on the connector board to the red and blue rails.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To
get power and ground to the other set of rails, we then run wires from
one red rail to the other and from one blue rail to the other. </span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like: </span></p><p></p>

that we have power and ground on both sides of the board, we can start
wiring our components. &nbsp;We'll ultimately want four buttons and
four LEDs arranged in a diamond pattern, so we start by wiring the
first button towards the top of the breadboard. &nbsp;If you recall
from Project ???, to wire a button to a GPIO, the circuit schematic
should look as follows:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><img style="width: 822px; height: 362px;" alt="" src="img/Pushbutton-to-GPIO.png"></span></span></p><br><p>To
implement that circuit on the breadboard, we wire one side of the
button to ground and wire the other side of the button to a GPIO.
&nbsp;We're going to choose GPIO 14 for our implementation; you're
welcome to use a different GPIO, but if you do, keep in mind that
you'll have to modify the code we provide to match your GPIO selection.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like: </span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-1but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #3</span>: &nbsp;Wire Your Second Button Using a GPIO Input</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">We
can now wire the second button similarly to the first. &nbsp;Again,
remember that we're looking to build a diamond pattern, so this button
should be positioned appropriately. &nbsp;For our circuit, we're going
to attach the second button to GPIO 15.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like:</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-2but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">You'll
notice that we used two small jumper wires to attache the second button
to ground. &nbsp;You could certainly use one longer wire to attach the
button, but we've found that the whole circuit will look cleaner by
using the small jumpers as much as possible.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #4</span>: &nbsp;Wire Your Third Button Using a GPIO Input</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">We can now wire the third button just like the first two. &nbsp;For this button, we've chosen to use GPIO 22.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like:</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-3but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #5</span>: &nbsp;Wire Your Fourth Button Using a GPIO Input</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">It's time to wire our fourth and final button in our circuit. &nbsp;For this last button, we've chosen to use GPIO 17.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like with all the buttons wired:</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-4but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><p>Good
job! &nbsp;You should now have four buttons wired on your breadboard.
&nbsp;Before we wire up any more components, let's write some code to
test that the buttons are wired correctly and are operating as we
expect...</p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Programming Implementation</span></h2><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Our test code is going to have two
sections -- the first will import the functions we're going to need for
the rest of the code and the second will test each of the buttons.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><br>Code Section #1</span>: &nbsp;Import Needed Functions</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
first part of our code is going to import the one library and function
we'll need later in our code. &nbsp;For this test code, the only
function we'll need is the Button() function from the rstem.button
library.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's what this introductory code should look like:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">INSERT CODE</span></p><p>import
rstem</p>
<p>from
rstem.button import Button</p><br><p style="font-weight: bold;">Code Section #2: &nbsp;Test Buttons</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To
test the LEDs, we'll assign each one to its own variable, and then --
in a WHILE loop -- we'll check for each button being pressed and will
display any button presses in the Code Output window.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's what the LED test code should look like:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">INSERT CODE</span></p><p>from
rstem.button import Button</p><p>button1
=&nbsp;Button(1)</p><p>button2
