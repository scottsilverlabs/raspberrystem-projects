<h1>SIMON 1</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">We've come a long way in the past
several
projects, and we're now ready to build and program&nbsp;a
working pattern-matching game (similar to the electronic Simon game).
The game will require four different colored buttons (wired as GPIO
Inputs) and four LEDs (wired as GPIO Outputs). &nbsp;We'll also
need
four resistors -- one for each LED we'll be wiring. &nbsp;We will
essentially be replicating the circuit designs that we learned in
previous projects, but on a larger scale. &nbsp;And we'll be
writing
some longer and more complex code to handle all the game conditions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because the fully-built circuit will
use up a lot of
breadboard space
and require a lot of wires, we highly recommend starting this project
with an empty breadboard, and implementing the circuit in a way that's
similar to the diagrams we provide. &nbsp;Also, you'll notice that
we wire
the buttons, LEDs and other components in a specific pattern (a square
or diamond shape) -- this will help make our game more playable when
it's complete.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In
this project, we'll wire up the four buttons and write some code to
verify they are working. &nbsp;In the next project, we'll wire up
the
four LEDs and write some code to verify they are working. &nbsp;At
that
point, the circuit is complete, and we'll spend several additional
projects building the code to make the game fully operating.
&nbsp;Take
your time, follow along, and pretty soon, you'll playing an electronic
game that YOU built and programmed!</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware
Implementation</span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For
this project, we're going to recommend that you clear your breadboard.
&nbsp;While half the breadboard should be sufficient space,
starting
with a clean board can help avoid confusion in your wiring.
&nbsp;We also suggest trying to build this project on just the
left-hand side of breadboard -- by doing this, you should be able to
put some upcoming projects on the other side of the breadboard, which
is nice so that you won't have to tear down this project to make room
for the other. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware Step #1</span>:
&nbsp;Provide Power to Both Power Rails</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Because
this circuit is going to be a bit larger than our previous circuits,
and because we're going to want to organize our components in a way
that we can actually use them later, we're going to make both power
rails (the red and blue strips on either side of the board) available.
&nbsp;As we've done previously, we make one set of power rails
functional by running wires from one of the 3.3V pins and one of the
GND pins on the connector board to the red and blue rails.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To
get power and ground to the other set of rails, we then run wires from
one red rail to the other and from one blue rail to the other. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like: </span></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-0but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #2</span>:
&nbsp;Wire Your First Button Using a GPIO Input</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Now
that we have power and ground on both sides of the board, we can start
wiring our components. &nbsp;We'll ultimately want four buttons and
four LEDs arranged in a diamond pattern, so we start by wiring the
first button towards the top of the breadboard. &nbsp;If you recall
from <a href="USING_BUTTONS_WITH_GPIO.html">Using Buttons
With GPIO</a>, to wire a button to a GPIO, the circuit schematic
should look as follows:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><img style="width: 822px; height: 362px;" alt="" src="img/Pushbutton-to-GPIO.png"></span></span></p>
<br>
<p>To
implement that circuit on the breadboard, we wire one side of the
button to ground and wire the other side of the button to a GPIO.
&nbsp;We're going to choose GPIO14 for our implementation; you're
welcome to use a different GPIO, but if you do, keep in mind that
you'll have to modify the code we provide to match your GPIO selection.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-1but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #3</span>:
&nbsp;Wire Your Second Button Using a GPIO Input</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">We
can now wire the second button similarly to the first. &nbsp;Again,
remember that we're looking to build a diamond pattern, so this button
should be positioned appropriately. &nbsp;For our circuit, we're
going
to attach the second button to GPIO15.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-2but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">You'll
notice that we used two small jumper wires to attache the second button
to ground. &nbsp;You could certainly use one longer wire to attach
the
button, but we've found that by using the small wires, you won't have
the larger wires getting in the way while you're trying to use the
buttons to play your game. &nbsp;Not to mention, the whole circuit
will look cleaner by
using the small jumpers as much as possible.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #4</span>:
&nbsp;Wire Your Third Button Using a GPIO Input</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">We can now wire the third
button just like the first two. &nbsp;For this button, we've chosen
to use GPIO22.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-3but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #5</span>:
&nbsp;Wire Your Fourth Button Using a GPIO Input</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">It's time to wire our fourth
and final button in our circuit. &nbsp;For this last button, we've
chosen to use GPIO17.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like with all the buttons wired:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-4but-0led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p>
<p>Good
job! &nbsp;You should now have four buttons wired on your
breadboard.
&nbsp;Before we wire up any more components, let's write some code
to
test that the buttons are wired correctly and are operating as we
expect...</p>
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br>
</span>
<h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Programming
Implementation</span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Our test code is going to have
two
sections -- the first will import the functions we're going to need for
the rest of the code and the second will test each of the buttons.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><br>
Code Section #1</span>: &nbsp;Import Needed Functions</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
first part of our code is going to import the one library and function
we'll need later in our code. &nbsp;For this test code, the only
function we'll need is the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Button()</span>
function from the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">rstem.button</span>
library.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's what the import
code should look like:</span></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>from rstem.button import Button
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Code Section #2:
&nbsp;Test Buttons</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To
test a button, we'll initialize it just like we did in <a href="USING_BUTTONS_WITH_GPIO.html">Using Buttons
With GPIO</a>, and we can then check for the button being pressed and
display a message to the Output Window when it is being
pressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's what the&nbsp;LED
test code
should look like for one of the buttons:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>button1 = Button(14)
if button1.is_pressed():
print("Button 1 is pressed")
else:
print("Button 1 NOT pressed")
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>If you replicate that code for each of the buttons and put the
whole thing in a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span>&nbsp;loop,
you will
now have the ability to test each of the buttons in your circuit.
&nbsp;This code will be useful later if, after adding more
components to your circuit, you find that the code isn't working
properly. &nbsp;Using this code will allow you to test the buttons
independently of the other components.</p>
<h2>Executing Your Code</h2>
<p>Here is what your full set of code should look like at this
point:
</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>from rstem.button import Button()
button1 = Button(14)
button2 = Button(15)
button3 = Button(22)
button4 = Button(17)
while True:
if button1.is_pressed():
print("Button 1 is pressed")
else:
print("Button 1 NOT pressed")
if button2.is_pressed():
print("Button 2 is pressed")
else:
print("Button 2 NOT pressed")
if button3.is_pressed():
print("Button 3 is pressed")
else:
print("Button 3 NOT pressed")
if button4.is_pressed():
print("Button 4 is pressed")
else:
print("Button 4 NOT pressed")
</textarea></div>
<p></p>
<p>If you run this code, you should see the status of each button
being updated in the Output Window.</p>
