<h1>HANDLING ERRORS IN YOUR CODE</h1>
<p>If the output from your "Hello, World!" program isn't what you
expect and/or
if you get an error message in the Output Window, this is likely due to
making a mistake typing in your code.&nbsp;Don’t worry, this
happens to all of us at some point or another – you may have made a
little mistake (like misspelling a word) or you may have made a
bigger mistake. Luckily, with this first program, we should be able
to figure out pretty easily where the mistake is.</p>
<p>And even if you didn't make any mistakes, follow along, as
this information will be important when the code gets more complex and
errors are inevitable...</p>
<br>
<h2>Common Mistakes in Your First Program<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></h2>
<p>Let’s discuss
where the common mistakes might be in your program, and once you
think you have them fixed, go ahead and click the Play icon again to
have the computer run the program another time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Common Mistake
#1: Capitalization is Important</b></p>
<p>The most common
mistake is not capitalize words in your program correctly. In this
case, the word&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier;">print</span>
is a command word (it tells the computer
to do something), and it needs to be all lowercase. Verify that you
haven’t capitalized any of the letters in the word&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier;">print</span>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Common Mistake
#2: Not Using Parentheses – “(” and “)” – Correctly</b></p>
<p>If you’ve checked
your capitalization and that wasn’t the problem, next verify that
you have parentheses around the <span style="font-family: Courier;">“Hello,
World!”</span> part of your
code.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Common Mistake
#3: Not Using Quotation Marks&nbsp;</b><b>–</b><b>
(") – Correctly</b></p>
<p>If your
capitalization is correct and you’ve used the parentheses
correctly, the next thing to check is that you’ve correctly put
quotation marks around <span style="font-family: Courier;">“Hello,
World!”</span> It doesn’t matter if
you’ve chosen to use single quotation marks (<span style="font-family: Courier;">‘</span>) or double
quotation marks (<span style="font-family: Courier;">“</span>),
as long as you have the same on both sides.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Interpreting
Error Messages</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hopefully,
by now, you've been able to fix any mistakes and the program is running
as you expect. &nbsp;But, there will be times -- especially as your
code gets more complicated -- that fixing mistakes isn't as easy as
those above. &nbsp;In fact, for programmers who are writing very
complex code, there are lots of tools and other software strictly aimed
at "debugging" (fixing) code. &nbsp;I don't expect that we'll need
any fancy tools for the code we'll be writing, but it will be helpful
to learn a little bit about the error messages that the IDE will spit
out when you make a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span>As
an example, let's change your original code above to the following:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>frint ("Hello, World!")
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>You'll notice that we "accidentally" changed the word "print"
to the
word "frint." &nbsp;Because Python doesn't have a command called
"frint," it
doesn't know what to do what this instruction (just like if I asked you
to frint something, you wouldn't know what I was talking about either).
&nbsp;So, instead of trying to guess what you wanted to do, the
computer
instead stops running your code and gives you an error message, which
is displayed in your Code Output window.</p>
<p>Here is the error message you will see (or something very
close to this):</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<div class="output">
<div></div>
<pre><span style="color: red;">Traceback (most recent call last):</span><br style="color: red;"><span style="color: red;">   File "</span>/home/pi/projects/Untitled1.py<span style="color: red;">", line 1 in "module"</span><br>      frint('Hello, World!')<br><span style="color: red;">NameError: name 'frint' is not defined</span><br style="color: red;"><span style="color: red;">-- Program Finished --</span><br></pre></div>
<p></p>
<p>There are four lines to this error message -- let's look at
each individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Line
1: &nbsp;This line can be ignored. &nbsp;It is just indicating
that the lines
following it will be providing information on the error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line
2: &nbsp;This tells you where the error occured -- both the name of
the file
and the line number. &nbsp;Note that your code could be written in
multiple
files, so it's possible that the code you see in your Code Window isn't
the code that has the specific issue you're being alerted to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line
3: &nbsp;This tells you the specific line of code that the computer
had an
issue with. &nbsp;It should be the line that is mentioned in Line
2, but
this way you can easily see the bad line of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line 4: &nbsp;This is the error (the specific problem
that the computer had with
your code). &nbsp;In some cases, the error will be clear enough
that you'll
know exactly what the problem is; in other cases, you'll have to do a
little more investigation, as the error isn't as simple as the computer
not recognizing a command.</p></li><li><p>Line 5: &nbsp;This just indicates that the program has completed or was stopped due to the error.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest error messages
will have four lines, just like this one. &nbsp;Line 1 will always
be the
same as above and Line 4 will always contain the specific error that
the computer is complaining about (Line 5 may change to&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">-- Program Stopped --</span>). &nbsp;But, sometimes the
computer will
find errors that stem from multiple locations. &nbsp;If the errors
stem from
multiple locations, Lines 2 and 3 may be repeated multiple times, each
time with a different file/line number (on the first line) and line of
code (on the second line). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In general, the location line of
code you're going to need to fix is going to be indicated in the two
lines right before the final line of the error message.</p>
