  <h1>HANDLING ERRORS</h1>

  <p>If the output from one of your programs isn't what you expect or if you
  get an error message in the Output Window, this is likely due to a mistake in
  your code.</p>
  <h2>Common Programming Mistakes</h2>

  <p>Let's use our <a href="HELLO,_WORLD.html">HELLO, WORLD!</a> project as an
  example. Recall, the program from that example was:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
print ("Hello, World!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you've received error when running this code, it's likely due to one of
  the common mistakes below.</p>
  <h4>Common Mistake #1: Capitalization is Important</h4>

  <p>The most common mistake is incorrect capitalization of words in your
  program. In this case, the word <code>print</code> is a command word (it
  tells the computer to do something), and it needs to be all lowercase. Verify
  that you haven’t capitalized any of the letters in the word
  <code>print</code>.</p>
  <h4>Common Mistake #2: Not Using Parentheses – “(” and “)” – Correctly</h4>

  <p>If you’ve checked your capitalization and that wasn’t the problem, next
  verify that you have parentheses around the <code>“Hello, World!”</code> part
  of your code.</p>
  <h4>Common Mistake #3: Not Using Quotation Marks – (") – Correctly</h4>

  <p>If your capitalization is correct and you’ve used the parentheses
  correctly, the next thing to check is that you’ve correctly put quotation
  marks around <code>“Hello, World!”</code> It doesn’t matter if you’ve chosen
  to use single quotation marks (<code>'</code>) or double quotation marks
  (<code>"</code>), as long as you have the same on both sides.</p>
  <h2>Interpreting Error Messages</h2>

  <p>Hopefully, by now, you've been able to fix any mistakes and the program is
  running as you expect. But, there will be times -- especially as your code
  gets more complicated -- that fixing mistakes isn't as easy as those above.
  In fact, for programmers who are writing very complex code, there are lots of
  tools and other software strictly aimed at "debugging" (fixing) code. Let's
  learn a little bit about the error messages that the RDE will spit out when
  you make a mistake.</p>

  <p>As an example, let's change your original code above to the following:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
frint("Hello, World!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>You'll notice that we "accidentally" changed the word "print" to the word
  "frint." Because Python doesn't have a command called "frint," it doesn't
  know what to do what this instruction (just like if we asked you to frint
  something, you wouldn't know what we were talking about either). So, instead
  of trying to guess what you wanted to do, the computer instead stops running
  your code and gives you an error message, which is displayed in the Output
  Window.</p>

  <p>Here is the error message you will see (or something very close to
  this):</p>
  <div class="output">
    <pre>
<span style="color: red;">Traceback (most recent call last):</span><br style=
"color: red;"><span style=
"color: red;">   File "</span>/home/pi/projects/Untitled.py<span style=
"color: red;">", line 1 in "module"</span><br>      frint("Hello, World!")<br><span style="color: red;">NameError: name 'frint' is not defined</span><br style="color: red;"><span style="color: red;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span><br>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>There are four lines to this error message -- let's look at each
  individually:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>Line 1: This line is generally always the same. It is just indicating
      that the lines following it will be providing information on the
      error.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Line 2: This tells you where the error occurred -- both the name of
      the file and the line number. Note that your code could be written in
      multiple files, so it's possible that the code you see in your Code
      Window isn't the code that has the specific issue you're being alerted
      to.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Line 3: This tells you the specific line of code that the computer had
      an issue with. It should be the line that is mentioned in Line 2, but
      this way you can easily see the bad line of code.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Line 4: This is the error (the specific problem that the computer had
      with your code). In some cases, the error will be clear enough that
      you'll know exactly what the problem is; in other cases, you'll have to
      do a little more investigation, as the error isn't as simple as the
      computer not recognizing a command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Line 5: This just indicates that the program has completed or was
      stopped due to the error.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The simplest error messages will have four lines, just like this one. Line
  1 will always be the same as above and Line 4 will always contain the
  specific error that the computer is complaining about (Line 5 may change to
  <strong>-- PROGRAM STOPPED --</strong>). But, sometimes the computer will
  find errors that stem from multiple locations. If the errors stem from
  multiple locations, Lines 2 and 3 may be repeated multiple times, each time
  with a different file/line number (on the first line) and line of code (on
  the second line). In general, look towards the end of the error message for
  the location and type of error that occurred.</p>
