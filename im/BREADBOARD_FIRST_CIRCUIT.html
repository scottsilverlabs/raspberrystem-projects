<h1>BREADBOARDING YOUR FIRST CIRCUIT</h1>
<p>In our previous
project (<a href="YOUR_FIRST_CIRCUIT.html">Your First
Circuit</a>), we built the following circuit using a battery,
an LED and a resistor:</p>
<p></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
</p>
<p>We’re now going to
build that same circuit again, but this time using the breadboard on
our RaspberrySTEM. &nbsp;We'll need all three components from the
previous project (pictured above), plus&nbsp;the two bare wires (silver
wires about 1" in length) and the two round&nbsp;adhesive white dots
included in the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM Cell </span>bag.</p><p>If you haven't read <a href="USING_THE_BREADBOARD.html">Using The Breadboard</a>, we highly recommend you do so now. &nbsp;You'll
need that information for not only this projects, but for all future
projects as well -- from here on out, everything we build will be on
our breadboard. </p>
<h2>Breadboarding Our Circuit - Step By Step</h2><p>Let’s look back at our example schematic from <a href="YOUR_FIRST_SCHEMATIC.html">Your First Schematic</a> (which is a schematic of the circuit above):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
</p>
<p>To implement that
design (or any design) on our breadboard, we follow the schematic from power (the
+ terminal of the battery) to
ground (the - terminal of the battery), inserting each component along
the way.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this
step-by-step:</p><p></p>
<p><b>Step #1: &nbsp;Build our power source</b></p><p>We discussed in <a href="USING_THE_BREADBOARD.html">Using The Breadboard</a>
how we can power our circuits in any number of ways. &nbsp;While the
RaspberrySTEM itself can provide power to the breadboard and the
circuits that are on the breadboard -- and we'll be using the
RaspberrySTEM for power starting in the next project -- we want to give
you an example of how other power sources can be used instead.
&nbsp;So, for this project, we're going to use the 3V lithium battery
that we used in <a href="YOUR_FIRST_CIRCUIT.html">Your First Circuit</a> to power our first breadboard circuit.</p><p>To
use the 3V battery as the "power supply" for the breadboard in this
project, we need to modify it a bit so that it can "plug into" the
breadboard. &nbsp;The first step in doing that is to&nbsp;attach one of
the bare wires to the (+) side of the 3V battery using one of the adhesive white dots. &nbsp;We
also recommend writing a (+) sign on the white dot so we can remember
which side of the battery is the (+) side. &nbsp;We'll need this
information later.</p><p>Next, we want to attach the other bare wire to the (-) side of the battery using the other adhesive white dot.</p><p>At this point, you should have something that resembles this:</p><p>INSERT PIC OF BATTERY POWER SUPPLY</p><p>This
is going to serve as&nbsp;our&nbsp;power supply for this project.
&nbsp;And we're now ready to start building our circuit...</p><p></p><p><b>Step #2: &nbsp;Provide power (and ground) to the
breadboard</b><br>
</p>
<p>If you follow the schematic starting from the battery, the first
component you hit is the battery itself. &nbsp;Here is that part of the
schematic:</p><p></p><p style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: center;">
<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 239px; height: 181px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Battery-Only.png"></p><p></p><p>In
other words, the first step in breadboarding your circuit is to hook up
power supply (that we created in Step #1 above) to the breadboard.
&nbsp;To do this, we first want to take the bare wire that is attached
to the (+) side of the battery and insert it into one of the holes
along the red strip of the breadboard rail. &nbsp;Then, we want to take
the bare wire that is attached to the (-) side of the battery and
insert it into one of the holes along the adjacent blue strip.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>It
may be a little difficult to get the wires into the breadboard holes,
as these wires aren't specifically made for this purpose. &nbsp;But,
this will be the last project where we're using the battery, so don't
worry about bending the wires. &nbsp;Also note that the wires are
short, so it's quite likely the battery will be sticking up in the air
once the wires are inserted into the breadboard.</p><p>This is what your breadboard should look like:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 891px; height: 365px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Battery_Only_bb.png"></p><p><br></p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> &nbsp;You'll want to ensure
that the two bare wires are not touching each other, as that would
short the battery (the electric current would run from the (+) terminal
of the battery directly to the (-) terminal of the battery, and quickly
drain all the power.</p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">The
wire attached to the (+) side of the battery is your power, and because
all holes in the red rail strip are connected together, we have now
provided power to that entire row of the breadboard. &nbsp;The wire
attached to the (-) side of the battery is your ground, and because all
holes in the blue strip are connected together, we have now provided
ground that entire strip of the breadboard.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<b>Step #3: &nbsp;Connect the resistor to the (+) side of the battery</b></p>
<p>If we following the schematic around the loop, the next component we
come to is the resistor, which is attached to the (+) terminal of the
battery:</p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 307px; height: 213px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Resistor-Added.png"></div><p></p><p>In
the Your First Circuit project, we learned that by touching the
components together, we complete the circuit and allow electric charge
to flow. &nbsp;The breadboard allows us to do the exact same thing
(complete the circuit) but in a way that doesn't involve the components
directly touching. &nbsp;</p><p>Remember that we said earlier that the
entire strip of&nbsp;holes along the red rail is connected together and
the entire strip of holes along the blue rail is connected together?
What this means is that if you plug a component into one of the holes
along the red strip (or blue strip) and then plug another component
into another hole along the red strip (or blue strip), those components
are effectively touching each other. &nbsp;In actuality, they are
connected by a piece of metal underneath the breadboard, but because
metal conducts electric current (allows it to flow), it is no different
than those components directly touching one another.</p><p>So, to
connect the resistor to the (+) side of the battery like in our
schematic, we need to plug one side of the resistor (one lead of the
resistor) into the same strip as the wire attached to the (+) side of
the battery. &nbsp;That's the red strip. &nbsp;If we insert one lead of
the resistor into the red strip, we've now made a connection between
the (+) side of the battery and the resistor.</p><p>In the next step,
we're going to want to connect the other lead of the resistor to
another component, so for the time being, we can insert that other
resistor lead into any other connect strip (one of the 5-hole strips)
on the breadboard. &nbsp;We'll come back to it soon.</p><p>Here is what the breadboard should now look like:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 980px; height: 402px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Resistor_Added_bb.png"></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> &nbsp;Don't be afraid to bend the resistor leads as necessary -- that's what they're made for!</p><br><p><b>Step #4: &nbsp;Connect the LED to the resistor</b></p>
<p>Following the schematic around further, the component we get to is the LED:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 449px; height: 210px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-LED-Added.png"></p><p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">We want to connect one
lead (specifically the longer lead) of the LED to the second lead of
the resistor. &nbsp;In the last step, we inserted the second lead of
the resistor into one of the 5-hole connect strips, and as we learned
earlier, all five holes in a connect strip are connected together.
&nbsp;So, to connect the lead of the LED to the lead of the resistor,
all we need to do is insert the LED lead into one of the other holes in
the same connect strip that the resistor is plugged into.</span></p><p>Then,
in preparation for the next step, we can plug the other lead of the LED
into any other 5-hole connect strip on the breadboard.<br><br>This is about what your breadboard should look like now:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1011px; height: 414px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_LED_Added_bb.png"></p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><br></span><p><b>Step #5: &nbsp;Complete the circuit by attaching the LED to ground</b></p>
<p>If we continue to follow our schematic around the loop, you'll see
that the final step is to connect the second lead of the LED to the (-)
terminal of the battery:</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 411px; height: 222px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit.png"></p><p></p><p>We
know that the second lead of the LED is now connected to all the holes
in the connect strip that it's inserted into, and we also know that the
(-) terminal of the battery is connected to the entire blue strip along
the breadboard rail. &nbsp;So, to connect the second lead of the LED to
the (-) terminal of the battery, all we need to do is to connect any of
the holes in that connect strip to the blue rail strip using a wire.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>&nbsp;At
this point, you're out of wires from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM Cell</span>. &nbsp;If you look around your
kit, you should be able to find a very small little plastic bag that
contains 20 half-inch green wires. &nbsp;You can grab one of those to
finish up this step.</p><p>Take one of the green half-inch wires and use it to connect the second lead of the LED to the blue rail strip, like this:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1015px; height: 415px;" alt="" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_bb.png"></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>&nbsp;You
may need to press the edges of the green wire pretty firmly to get them
fully inserted into the breadboard. &nbsp;You'll know that they are
fully inserted when the entire green wire is touching the breadboard.</p><p>If everything is wired correctly, your circuit should be completed, electricity should be flowing, and
your LED should be lit! &nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations...you just built your first circuit using a breadboard!</p><p></p>
