  <p>In our previous project (<a href="YOUR_FIRST_CIRCUIT.html">YOUR FIRST
  CIRCUIT</a>), we built the following circuit using a battery, an LED and a
  resistor:</p><img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Circuit_complete_bb.png"
  alt="">

  <p>We’re now going to build that same circuit again, but this time using the
  breadboard on our RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit. We'll need all three components
  from the previous project (pictured above), plus the two bare wires (silver
  wires about 1" in length) and the two round adhesive white dots. All of these
  parts are included in the <strong>Your First Circuit RaspberrySTEM
  Cell</strong> bag. In addition, you're going to need a single green "jumper
  wire" -- this is a half-inch long green wire that is in a small plastic bag
  packaged inside of a larger bag of wires.</p>

  <p>If you haven't read <a href="USING_THE_BREADBOARD.html">USING THE
  BREADBOARD</a>, we highly recommend you do so now. You'll need that
  information for not only this projects, but for all future projects as well
  -- from here on out, everything we build will be on our breadboard.</p>
  <h2>Breadboarding Our Circuit - Step By Step</h2>

  <p>Hopefully, you've also read <a href="YOUR_FIRST_SCHEMATIC.html">YOUR FIRST
  SCHEMATIC</a> and have a general idea of how a schematic works. Here is the
  example we used in that lesson, which also happens to be the schematic of our
  first circuit (pictured above):</p><img class="schematic" style=
  "width: 636px; height: 343px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit.png">

  <p>To implement that design (or any design) on our breadboard, we will follow
  the schematic from power (the + terminal of the battery) to ground (the -
  terminal of the battery), inserting each component along the way.</p>

  <p>Let’s look at this step-by-step:</p>
  <h4>Step #1: Build our power source</h4>

  <p>We discussed in <a href="USING_THE_BREADBOARD.html">USING THE
  BREADBOARD</a> how we can power our circuits in any number of ways. While the
  RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit itself can provide power to the breadboard and the
  circuits that are on the breadboard -- and we'll be using the RaspberrySTEM
  CREATOR Kit for power starting in the next project -- we want to give you an
  example of how other power sources can be used instead.</p>

  <p>So, for this project, we're going to use the 3V lithium battery that we
  used in <a href="YOUR_FIRST_CIRCUIT.html">YOUR FIRST CIRCUIT</a> to power our
  first breadboard circuit.</p>

  <p>To use the 3V battery as the "power supply" for the breadboard in this
  project, we need to modify it a bit so that it can "plug into" the
  breadboard. The first step in doing that is to attach one of the bare wires
  to the (+) side of the 3V battery using one of the adhesive white dots. We
  also recommend writing a (+) sign on the white dot so we can remember which
  side of the battery is the (+) side. We'll need this information later.</p>

  <p>Next, we want to attach the other bare wire to the (-) side of the battery
  using the other adhesive white dot.</p>

  <p>At this point, you should have something that resembles
  this:</p><img style="width: 321px; height: 362px;" alt="" src=
  "img/batcropshop.jpg">

  <p>This is going to serve as our power supply for this project. And we're now
  ready to start building our circuit...</p>
  <h4>Step #2: Provide power (and ground) to the breadboard</h4>

  <p>If you follow the schematic starting from the battery, the first component
  you hit is the battery itself. Here is that part of the
  schematic:</p><img class="schematic" style=
  "border: 0px solid ; width: 239px; height: 181px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Battery-Only.png">

  <p>In other words, the first step in breadboarding your circuit is to hook up
  the power supply (that we created in Step #1 above) to the breadboard. To do
  this, we first want to take the silver wire that is attached to the (+) side
  of the battery and insert it into one of the holes along the red strip of the
  breadboard rail. Then, we want to take the silver wire that is attached to
  the (-) side of the battery and insert it into one of the holes along the
  adjacent blue strip.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It may be a little difficult to get the wires into
  the breadboard holes, as these wires aren't specifically made for this
  purpose. But, this will be the last project where we're using the battery, so
  it doesn't matter if the wires bend or don't look very good. Also note that
  the wires are short, so it's quite likely the battery will be sticking up in
  the air once the wires are inserted into the breadboard.</p>

  <p>This is what your breadboard should look like:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Breadboard_Battery_Only_bb.png" alt="">

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll want to ensure that the two bare wires are
  not touching each other, as that would "short" the battery (meaning that the
  electric current would run from the (+) terminal of the battery directly to
  the (-) terminal of the battery, and quickly drain all the power.</p>

  <p>The wire attached to the (+) side of the battery is your power, and
  because all holes in the red rail strip are connected together, we have now
  provided power to that entire row of the breadboard. The wire attached to the
  (-) side of the battery is your ground, and because all holes in the blue
  strip are connected together, we have now provided ground that entire strip
  of the breadboard.</p>
  <h4>Step #3: Connect the resistor to the (+) side of the battery</h4>

  <p>If we following the schematic around the loop, the next component we come
  to is the resistor, which is attached to the (+) terminal of the
  battery:</p><img class="schematic" style="width: 400px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Resistor-Added.png">

  <p>In the <a href="YOUR_FIRST_CIRCUIT.html">YOUR FIRST CIRCUIT</a> project,
  we learned that by touching the components together, we complete the circuit
  and allow electric charge to flow. The breadboard allows us to do the exact
  same thing (complete the circuit) but in a way that doesn't involve the
  components directly touching.</p>

  <p>Remember that we said earlier that the entire strip of holes along the red
  rail is connected together and the entire strip of holes along the blue rail
  is connected together? What this means is that if you plug a component into
  one of the holes along the red strip (or blue strip) and then plug another
  component into another hole along the red strip (or blue strip), those
  components are effectively touching each other. In actuality, they are
  connected by a piece of metal underneath the breadboard, but because metal
  conducts electric current (allows it to flow), it is no different than those
  components directly touching one another.</p>

  <p>So, to connect the resistor to the (+) side of the battery like in our
  schematic, we need to plug one side of the resistor (one lead of the
  resistor) into the same strip as the wire attached to the (+) side of the
  battery. That's the red strip. If we insert one lead of the resistor into the
  red strip, we've now made a connection between the (+) side of the battery
  and the resistor.</p>

  <p>In the next step, we're going to want to connect the other lead of the
  resistor to another component, so for the time being, we can insert that
  other resistor lead into any other connect strip (one of the 5-hole strips)
  on the breadboard. We'll come back to it soon.</p>

  <p>Here is what the breadboard should now look like:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Breadboard_Resistor_Added_bb.png" alt="">

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Don't be afraid to bend the resistor leads as
  necessary -- that's what they're made for!</p>
  <h4>Step #4: Connect the LED to the resistor</h4>

  <p>Following the schematic around further, the next component we get to is
  the LED:</p><img class="schematic" style="width: 449px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-LED-Added.png">

  <p>We want to connect one lead (specifically the longer lead) of the LED to
  the second lead of the resistor. In the last step, we inserted the second
  lead of the resistor into one of the 5-hole connect strips, and as we learned
  earlier, all five holes in a connect strip are connected together. So, to
  connect the lead of the LED to the lead of the resistor, all we need to do is
  insert the LED lead into one of the other holes in the same connect strip
  that the resistor is plugged into.</p>

  <p>Then, in preparation for the next step, we can plug the other lead of the
  LED into any other 5-hole connect strip on the breadboard. This is about what
  your breadboard should look like now:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Breadboard_LED_Added_bb.png" alt="">
  <h4>Step #5: Complete the circuit by attaching the LED to ground</h4>

  <p>If we continue to follow our schematic around the loop, you'll see that
  the final step is to connect the second lead of the LED to the (-) terminal
  of the battery:</p><img class="schematic" style="width: 411px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit.png">

  <p>We know that the second lead of the LED is now connected to all the holes
  in the connect strip that it's inserted into, and we also know that the (-)
  terminal of the battery is connected to the entire blue strip along the
  breadboard rail. So, to connect the second lead of the LED to the (-)
  terminal of the battery, all we need to do is to connect any of the holes in
  that connect strip to the blue rail strip using a wire.</p>

  <p>Take one of the green half-inch wires and use it to connect the second
  lead of the LED to the blue rail strip, like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Breadboard_bb.png" alt="">

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may need to press the edges of the green wire
  pretty firmly to get them fully inserted into the breadboard. You'll know
  that they are fully inserted when the entire green wire is touching the
  breadboard.</p>

  <p>If everything is wired correctly, your circuit should be completed,
  electricity should be flowing, and your LED should be lit!</p>

  <p>Congratulations...you just built your first circuit using a
  breadboard!</p>
