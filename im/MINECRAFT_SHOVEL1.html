<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In the previous projects, we remapped the control functions that
are typically handled by keyboard presses and implemented them in a
custom controller that we built.  In this project, we're going to 
start actually manipulating the game world by writing code directly
to the Minecraft server.  This will allow us to add new logic to our 
game, in addition to just remapping the various control functions.  

<p>In this specific project, we will learn how to monitor when 
Minecraft blocks have been hit and then gather and use that
information in our code.

<h2>Hardware Setup</h2>
<p>For this project, we need just a single button mapped to GPIO7.  
You are welcome to keep the hardware setup from a previous project 
that has a button attached to that GPIO, or you can simplify your
hardware to the following:
 
<img class="bb" src="img/Minecraft_1button_bb.png">

<h2>Writing Our Code</h2>

<p>Here is the code that will allow us to get information about a
block that was hit and then print out information about the block
that was hit. Below the code, we will discuss the line-by-line 
details:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1"> <div></div> <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control, block
import time

control.show()
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

button = Button(7)

while True:
    if button.presses():
        control.hit()

    hits = mc.events.pollBlockHits()
 
    for hit in hits:
        print "The X, Y, Z coordinates of the block you hit is:", blockHit.pos

    time.sleep(0.01)

</textarea></div>

<p>
Here's how the code works:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
On Lines 1-3, we import all the functions we'll later need for this code.
</p></li>
<li><p>
On Line 5, we use <code>control.show()</code> to open up the Minecraft window.  
</p></li>
<li><p>
On Line 6, we initalize a connection to the Minecraft server and store that in an object <code>mc</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
On Line 8, we create a Button object for the button attached to GPIO7
</p></li>
<li><p>
On Line 10, we implement a Game Loop that will continue forever (until we stop it).
</p></li>
<li><p>
On Lines 11-12, we check to see if our button has been pressed.  If so, we implement a "hit" -- 
the equivalent of a right mouse click when holding the sword.
</p></li>
<li><p>
On Line 14, we get a list of all hit events that have taken place since the last time
we ran this function.  We store that list of hits in a variable called <code>hits</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
On Lines 16-17, we implement a <code>for</code> that cycles through each hit event in our
<code>hits</code> variable, and then prints out the coordinates (X, Y, Z) of each block
that was hit since the last time we cycled through this function.
</p></li>
<li><p>
On Line 19, we implement a <code>sleep</code> to slow our game loop down, so as not to
over-burden the processor.
</p></li></ul>
