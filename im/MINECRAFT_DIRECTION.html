  <h2>The Introduction</h2>
  <h2>The Hardware</h2>

  <p>None required.</p>
  <h2>The Software</h2>The Minecraft Pi does not have any direct way to
  determine which direction Steve is facing. That’s a bummer, because if you
  did know which way you were facing, you could change the world directly in
  front of you. However, the RaspberrySTEM adds a couple new APIs to get the
  direction. They use some tricks to determine your direction. Because they use
  tricks, they have do briefly blank the screen - you’ll see the world turn
  black for about a half second when you call these functions. The first
  function is called get_heading(). It returns the angle you are pointing
  relative to the Z axis. import control.show() mc =
  minecraft.Minecraft.create() white True: print(control.get_heading(mc))
  time.sleep(1) When run, you’ll see the screen go black briefly, once a
  second. In the Program Output window, you see the angle printed. Try turning
  Steve around to watch the angle change. INFO Box: How get_heading works The
  second function, get_direction(), provides two angles - the first angle is
  your heading, similar to the angle provided by get_heading(). The second
  angle is the angle Steve is looking up or down. This function uses a
  different method to determine the angle, which is not as precise as
  get_heading(). So, if you want a more precise heading, use get_heading(). You
  can test get_direction() the same way as get_heading - just replace
  get_heading with get_direction in the code above. INFO Box: How get_direction
