    <div id=description>In this project, we continue the development of our our Space Invaders

<p>Now that we have the framebuffer initialized and have verified
that the LED Matrix is working, let's put our spaceship where it's
supposed to be located -- in the middle of the LED Matrix horizontally
(along the x-axis) and at the bottom of the LED Matrix vertically (y=0).</p>
<p>To determine the middle of the LED Matrix, we could take the
known length of it (8 pixels) and divide that by two -- that would give
us our middle dot (x=4). &nbsp;But, what if you later want to use
this code on a smaller or larger LED Matrix display? &nbsp;For
example, let's say you put four LED Matrices together to build a 16x16
display. &nbsp;If you put x=4 right into your code, when you run
the program on your new 16x16 display, your spaceship will no longer be
in the middle of the display.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have a way to handle this. &nbsp;There is a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">FrameBuffer</span> attribute called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">width</span>
that will determine how many LED Matrices you have chained together and
will tell you the width of your LED Matrix display. &nbsp;We can
use that attribute to determine the actual width of the display, and
then divide that actual width by 2 to get the starting position of our
spaceship.</p>
<br>
<div class="info">
<div>Hard-Coding</div>
<div><p>
This is actually a very common situation when programming for
a potentially changing environment -- you have to decide between
putting definitive numbers into your code&nbsp;(called
"hard-coding") based on the most common usage scenario, or by using
variables and inputs that will allow your code to adapt to different
scenarios. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hard-coding typically makes your code easier to write -- since
you don't have to test for lots of different situations and change the
functionality of your code for each possible situation. &nbsp;But,
hard-coding also means that your code will break (or at very least be
less useful) when exposed to a situation where the assumptions you made
about the environment are no longer true. &nbsp;In general, it's
best to try to figure out who will&nbsp;be using your software and the specific situations
where your code will be used, and then try to be as generic as possible
to accommodate the most common situations and environments.
</p></div>
</div>
<br>
<p>Here is what the initialization code for the initial position
of the&nbsp;ship would look like:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Initialize the spaceship
spaceship_position = fb.width / 2
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>In our previous project, we just drew the ship at x=3, y=0.
&nbsp;But, now we have the actual x-coordinate from our calculation
above, so we can draw the ship at it's actual starting position.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, there's one thing we need to keep in mind -- now that
we're using a calculation to determine the position of the ship, it's
possible that the result of our calculation won't be a whole number
(for example, if we were using an LED Matrix that was 7 pixels wide,
our initial position would be x=3.5). &nbsp;To accomodate for that,
we need to round our calcuation to the nearest whole number, and that
is where we will display our ship.</p>
<p>We do that using the built-in math function called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">round()</span>.
&nbsp;Here is what the code will look like:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Draw the spaceship
fb.point(round(spaceship_position),0)
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Finally, now is as good a time as any to put our pause at the
end of the game loop. &nbsp;We had discussed trying a pause of of
between .001 and .01 seconds. &nbsp;Let's start with the smaller
number and see if that poses any problems as we're continuing to
develop the game:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Import required functions/modules
import time

# Wait for some period of time
time.sleep(.001)
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Here is the full code for our game at this point:</p>
