    <div id=description>In this project, we continue the development of our Space Invaders
    game by initializing and drawing our ship at the correct location.</div>

<p>Now that we have the framebuffer initialized and have verified
that the LED Matrix is working, let's put our spaceship where it's
supposed to be located -- in the middle of the LED Matrix horizontally
(along the x-axis) and at the bottom of the LED Matrix vertically (y=0).</p>
<p>To determine the middle of the LED Matrix, we could take the
known width (8 dots) and divide that by two -- that would give
us our middle dot (x=4). But, what if you later want to use
this code on a smaller or larger LED Matrix display?  For
example, let's say you put four LED Matrices together to build a 16x16
display.  If you put x=4 right into your code, when you run
the program on your new 16x16 display, your spaceship will no longer be
in the middle of the display.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have a way to handle this.  There is a <code>FrameBuffer</code> attribute called
<code>width</code>
that will determine how many LED Matrices you have chained together and
will tell you the width of your LED Matrix display.  We can
use that attribute to determine the actual width of the display, and
then divide that actual width by 2 to get the starting position of our
spaceship.</p>
<p>Here is what the initialization code for the initial position
of the ship would look like:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Initialize the spaceship
spaceship_position = fb.width / 2
</textarea></div>

<p>In our previous project, we just drew the ship at x=3, y=0.
 But, now we have the actual x-coordinate from our calculation
above, so we can draw the ship at its actual starting position.
 </p>
<p>But, there's one thing we need to keep in mind -- now that
we're using a calculation to determine the position of the ship, it's
possible that the result of our calculation won't be a whole number
(for example, if we were using an LED Matrix that was 7 dots wide,
our initial position would be x=3.5).  To accommodate for that,
we need to round our calculation to the nearest whole number, and that
is where we will display our ship.</p>
<p>We do that using the built-in math function called <code>round()</code>.
 Here is what the code will look like:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Draw the spaceship
fb.point(round(spaceship_position),0)
</textarea></div>

<p>Finally, now is as good a time as any to put our pause at the
end of the game loop.  We had discussed trying a pause of of
between .001 and .01 seconds.  Let's start with the smaller
number and see if that poses any problems as we're continuing to
develop the game:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
# Import required functions/modules
import time

# Wait for some period of time
time.sleep(.001)
</textarea></div>

<p>Here is the full code for our game at this point:</p>
