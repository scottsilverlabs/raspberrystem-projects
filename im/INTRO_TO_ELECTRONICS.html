<h1>INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS</h1>
<h2>What is Electricity</h2>
<p>Simply stated,
electricity is a flow of charged particles (electrons). When charged
particles are allowed to flow from one place to another, they transfer
energy
that can be used to power everything from a light bulb to an entire
city. All of our everyday electronic gadgets – from cell phones to
computers to microwave ovens – are powered by the flow of these charged
particles,
which we commonly refer to as electricity or simply just "charge."</p>
<h2>What is a Circuit</h2>
<p>A circuit is a
closed loop that allows charged particles to flow through it.
 The parts of
a circuit that charged particles flow through are called conductors --
conductors are the building blocks of circuits, and wires are one
example of a conductor.  Wires and other conductors allow
charged particles to flow through them and when you string together
conductors in a closed loop, you have created an electric circuit.</p>
<p>A typical
circuit has a power source, conductors, and various other components.  The power
source forces charged particles to flow through the circuit.  The conductors
(wires) connect together the components in the circuit.  And, the components
are the parts of the circuit that are affected by the electricity  as it passes
through them. For example, a circuit may contain a battery and a lightbulb,
attached together with wires. The battery serves as the power source, which forces charged
particales through the wires.  When the charged particles flow through the lightbulb, it
illuminates.
</p>
<p>Some
circuits are
very simple (like our battery and lightbulb example), while other
circuits are very complicated, containing many power sources, 
conductors
and components.</p>
<h2>Voltage,
Current &amp; Resistance</h2>
<p>When
discussing
electricity and circuits, there are three major concepts that are
important to understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Voltage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resistance</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These
three concepts
define how and when electric charge flows, and controlling these things
allows us to harness the power that electricity
provides. While we can’t actually see voltage, current or
resistance, there are some analogies we can use to help understand
what each of these concepts are and how they interact with each other.
</p>
<p>Recall
that electricity is a flow of charged particles. Well, electricity
through wire (or any conductor)
is very similar, in principle, to how water flows through pipes. In
fact, to understand the basic components of electricity – voltage,
current and resistance – we’re going to use water flowing through
pipes as our analogy.</p>
<h3><b>Voltage</b></h3>
<p>Voltage is essentially the
difference in the amount of charge from one point in a circuit to
another. An important concept of electricity is that charge will
typically only
flow between two points that have a difference in charge (a voltage).
 Specifically, charged particles likes to flow from a point of
higher charge
to a point of lower charge. If there is the same amount of charge at
two points in a circuit, no electricity will flow.</p>
<p>Using our water
analogy, voltage is analogous to the amount of pressure there is
pushing water through a pipe.  Imagine a water system that
contains a water pump -- water enters the pump at a low pressure and is
ejected from the pump at a high pressure.  It is this pressure
difference on either side of the pump that generates the flow of water.
 Likewise in a circuit, the power source serves as the pump --
a power source takes in charge at a low voltage and pushes it out at a
high voltage.  It is this difference in voltage on the
opposite sides of of the power source that generates the flow of
charged particles.</p>
<p>Before we go any
further, let’s take a quick look at how a battery works. In a
battery, there are two “terminals” – a positive terminal and a
negative terminal. The positive terminal contains a lot of
positively charged particles and the negative terminal contains a lot
of negatively charged particles:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m69e7ef1a.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="170" width="590"></p>
<br>
<p>The difference in charge between the positive and negative
terminals creates a voltage, but there is a barrier
between the two terminals which keeps the positively charged
particles and the negatively charged particles from mixing together.
 But, if we were to place a conductor (like a wire) between
the positive terminal and the negative terminal, charged particles
would flow from one side to the other:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_3b280f49.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="161" width="495"></p>
<br>
<p>In fact, what you see above is what a typical battery-operated
electric circuit will look like
before you insert various components into the circuit loop. We could
easily insert a lightbulb into the circuit above and you would see
the lightbulb illuminate:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m184d94fb.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="396" width="574"></p>
<br>
<p>Keep this particular
circuit in mind, as we’ll be coming back to it often over the next
few projects.</p>
<h3><b>Current</b></h3>
<p>Current is a measure
of the amount of electric charge that flows through a circuit. Using
our
water analogy, if voltage is the amount of water pressure in a pipe,
current is the amount of water actually flowing through the pipe.</p>
<p>Take a look at these
two water pipes:</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_68411fab.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="229" width="735"></p>
<br>
<p>Each pipe has the
same amount of pressure pushing the water through, but notice that
the second pipe is smaller than the first. Because the second pipe
is smaller, less water will flow through it, despite having the same
amount of pressure. </p>
<p>What if we wanted to
get the same amount of water through the second pipe as the first,
but we couldn’t change the size of the pipes? The obvious solution
would be to increase the water pressure in the second pipe:</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_6e799d37.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="256" width="735"></p>
<br>
<p>In an electric
circuit, this would be equivalent to having to increase the amount of
voltage (charge differential) in the circuit in order to get the same
amount of charge to flow.</p>
<p>But, what does it
mean to have a “smaller pipe” in a circuit? That’s where
“resistance” comes in…</p>
<h3><b>Resistance</b></h3>
<p>If voltage is
analogous to the amount of water pressure in a pipe, and current is
analogous to the amount of water actually moving through the pipe,
then resistance is analogous to the size of the pipe being used. The
smaller the pipe, the harder you have to push to get the same amount
of water through the pipe. In a circuit, that equates to the higher
the resistance of the circuit, the more voltage you need to generate
the same amount of current.</p>
<p>But, in a circuit,
wires are generally the same size. So, you might be wondering --
what causes different amounts of resistance in an electric circuit?</p>
<p>The answer is that
lots of things can impact the resistance of a circuit, including type
of conductors being used (the
material through which the charge is flowing) and the resistance
of the components being used. As an example, different types of wire
will have different levels of resistance, which will ultimately
impact the current and voltage levels within the circuit. And some
mediums – like air – have a nearly infinite resistance, meaning
electricity won’t flow through it at all. In addition, there are
lots of times where we need to add resistance to a circuit (using
things called “resistors”) in order to control the flow of current in
the circuit.</p>
<p>Btw,
we just said above that charged particles won't flow through air,
but that's not completely true.  Lightning is a great example
of
electricity moving through air, but in order for electricity to move
from the clouds to the ground, it requires a tremendously high voltage
(meaning a tremendous difference in charge from the clouds to the
ground).  In fact, the voltages in a lightning strike are
about a
hundred million times greater than what we'll be working with in our
circuits.</p>
<h2>Power, Load, Ground</h2>
<p>In all circuits, we can talk about three parts of the
circuit:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power:</span>
 This is the point of highest charge in your circuit -- for
example, the positive terminal of your battery. This point in a circuit
is sometimes generically called "Vcc" or
in
the
case of the projects we'll be doing, "3.3V" (since the power source
we'll be using will be 3.3 volts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Load:</span>
 The part of the circuit that uses the charged particles --
the
components in the circuit -- is typically referred to as the Load.
 Above we talked about circuit resistance -- the Load is the
parts
of the circuit that provide resistance.  An example from our
earlier circuit would be the lightbulb -- that is a part of the circuit
Load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ground:</span>
 In an electric circuit, Ground is the point of lowest charge
in
the circuit.  For example, in our lightbulb circuit above, the
negative terminal of the battery is the point of lowest charge, and
would be the physical ground point of this circuit.
 Interestingly, the reason we use the term "Ground" is because
in
many electrical applications (like the electricity running through your
house), the earth is used as both our reference point of
lowest
charge and our physical point of attaching the electrical circuit.
 This is because the earth is able to receive nearly infinite
amounts of electricity without increasing its total charge, so we can
always assume that the voltage between a power source and the earth
will be constant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<div class="info">
<div>Grounding Yourself</div>
<div>
<p>In our assembly guide, we mentioned that you should "ground"
yourself
before touching electronic components.  Now that you have a
conceptual idea of what ground is, we can explain this further.
 Have you ever gotten a static shock by touching someone or
something?  I'm sure you have.  Sometimes, electric
charge builds up in your body.  This charge is then released
-- in the form of a static discharge (or shock) when you touch someone
or something that provides a connection to the earth.  Once
your body has discharged the excess charge, you don't get anymore
shocks -- until, of course, you build up more
charge.
</p>
<p>
If you were to touch an electrical component when you have a charge
built up in your body, that
resulting static shock that you feel could very well be enough to
zap the component and have it stop working properly (we sometimes call
this "frying the component.")  So, to avoid frying any
electrical components, we recommend that you discharge any excess
charge in your body before touching the components.  You can
do this easily by touching any piece of metal that is connected via
some relatively direct path to the earth.  Since all the
electrical outlets in your house are connected to the earth, you can
ground yourself easily by touching any piece of metal on any electrical
device that is plugged in.  For example, if you have a
computer or laptop that's plugged
in, you can touch any metal piece on it.  Or, you could touch
the screw that holds in a light switch.
</p>
<p>
All that said, even
without grounding yourself, some simple precautions can help lower the
risk of frying any components.  First, try to avoid walking on
carpet before handling an electrical component (you've probably noticed
that you'll get more shocks after walking on carpet). </p>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Resistive
Circuits, Open Circuits &amp; Short Circuits </h2>
<p>Where we have electricity flowing from a power source (Vcc),
through
one or more components (Load) and to a point of lower voltage (many
times 0V or Ground), we call that type of circuit a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resistive Circuit</span>.
 Creating a resistive circuit is the first step in creating a
useful piece of electronics.</p>
<p>Remember our battery and lightbulb circuit above?</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m184d94fb.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="396" width="574"></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is an example of a resistive circuit.</p>
<p>Sometimes
we don't have all the components of a resistive circuit, in which case
our electronics will typically not work as expected.  Two
common
examples are open circuits and short circuits: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Open Circuit</span>
– An open circuit is one that is not complete, and therefore electric
charge can’t flow. As mentioned earlier, electric charge can't easily
flow through air, so if a circuit is not complete, the electrical
current is experiencing nearly infinite resistance at some point in the
circuit and circuit will not function. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Short Circuit</span>
– A short circuit is what happens when the beginning of the circuit
(Vcc) is attached to the end of the circuit (Ground) with nothing (no
Load) in between.  Electricity can flow through wire
with almost no resistance, so attaching a wire from power to ground
with nothing in between will cause large amounts of electricity to flow
through that wire. This can dissipate your power source very quickly,
or worst-case, the large flow of current can heat up the wire to the
point where it breaks or causes a fire. </p>
