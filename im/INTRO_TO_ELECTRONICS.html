  <h1>What is Electricity?</h1>

  <p><mark>PIC: Need generic electricity image or diagram, or cartoon</mark>

  <p><mark>Very rough:

  <p>Electricity is a foundation of our modern lives in the 21st century.
  With electricty, we heat and light our homes; power our electronic toys,
  games and gadgets; and run our appliances, tools, and equipment.  But,
  perhaps most importantly, electricity enables us to use the microprocessor -
  the brain of all modern computers, including phones, laptops, tablets and
  more.

  <p>Simply stated, electricity involves the flow of charged particles (or more
  simply, a flow of "charge").  Charge is a physical property of matter.  When
  charged particles are allowed to flow from one place to another, they
  transfer energy that can be used to power everything from a light bulb to an
  entire city. All of our everyday electronic gadgets – from cell phones to
  computers to microwave ovens – are powered by the flow of charge.

  <p>Electricity occurs naturally in everyday phenomemon such a lightning bolts
  and static shocks.  But, only in the past few centuries, man has discovered
  how to convert differnet forms of energy to and from electrical energy.  This
  feat allows us to transmit energy over large distances nearly instaneously, and
  has revolutionized the use of heat, light, and motors throughtout our homes,
  offices, and factories.

  <p>And, just in the past 100 years, we've taken another step in creating the
  mirocprocessor, which harnesses the power of electricity to control the flow
  of information.  With the microprocessor, we can perform calculations a
  speeds that are not humanly possible...

  <h2>What is a Circuit?</h2>

  <p>A circuit is a closed loop that allows charge to flow through
  it. The parts of a circuit that charge flows through are called
  conductors -- conductors are the backbone of circuits, and are
  generally made from metal wires.  Conductors allow charge
  to flow through them and when you string together conductors in a
  closed loop, you have created an electric circuit.  A circuit does not have
  to be just one single closed loop - they generally contain many intertwined
  loops.
  <p>A typical circuit has a power source, conductors, and other
  components. The power source forces charge to flow through the
  circuit. The conductors (wires) connect together the components in the
  circuit. And, the components are the parts of the circuit that are affected
  by the electric charge as it passes through them.</p>

<mark>PIC: Battery lightbulb circuit - animated</mark>

  <p>For example, the circuit above contains a battery and a lightbulb, attached
  together with wires. The battery serves as the power source, which forces
  charged particles through the wires. When the charge flows through
  the lightbulb, it illuminates.</p>

  <p>Some circuits are very simple (like our battery and lightbulb example),
  while other circuits are very complicated, containing many power sources,
  wires and components.</p>

  <h1>The Water Analogy</h1>
  <p>Often, electricy can be a hard to get an intuitive understanding of because it
  is invisible.  Charged particles flow through wires, but you
  can't see them.  Because of this, it is often helpful to talk of the how the
  flow of <i>charge</i> through a <i>conductor</i> is very similar to the flow
  of <i>water</i> through a <i>pipe</i>. 
  <p>This analogy isn't perfect, because the charged particles AREN'T water
  molecules, and in some
  ways behave differently.  But there are
  many very strong similarities - often so similar that many of the equations we
  use to describe electric circuits are essentially the same equations used to
  describe the water flowing in pipes.  Most of the electrical concepts
  throughout the
  Projects Guide use the water analogy to give a simple and intuitive
  understanding of what is going on inside a circuit.  They are powerful and
  helpful, and can allow you to understand what's happening in a circuit
  without any equations.  However, along the way we'll discuss the differences,
  too, so you can see where the analogy doesn't work.
  <p>For example, a simple circuit with a battery is <i>analogous</i> to water
  flowing through a closed loop of pipe:
<p><mark>PIC: Battery only circuit - animated, compared to water analogy,
animated</mark>
  <p>But don't do this! If you do, you'll have created a short circuit, which
  we discuss in future projects - and you will quickly drain your battery.</p>
        
        <p>In this example, the battery (pump) forces charged particles (water)
        around a closed loop (circuit).  You'll notice the analogy between the
        electrical circuit and the water circuit:

  <h2>Power Source</h2>
  <p><mark>PIC: generic drawing or stock photo of a battery</mark>
  <p>Power sources provide the energy to make charge flow in circuits.  There
  are many different types of power sources, and we'll talk more about them in
  <a data-uid="sources"></a>.
    <p>In our simple circuit above, the power source is a battery.  A battery
    converts chemical energy into electrical energy.  That is, inside a battery,
    a specific chemical reaction occurs that causes charged particles to be
    pulled into one side of the battery, and pushed out the other.
    <p>In the water analogy, we model this as a pump - a device that pulls 
    water into one side, and pushes out the other, analogous to a
    battery.
    <p>What's great about this analogy is it is intuitively obvious that
    exactly as much stuff (charge/water) goes into the power source
    (battery/pump) as comes out.  The power source does not <i>create</i> charge
    just as a pump does not <i>create</i> water.
    <p>However, the water pump is just a <i>model</i> of the battery.  The
    battery does not have any spinning moving parts inside.  Both electrical
    batteries and water pumps are similar in that they convert one form of
    energy (chemical energy for the battery and mechanical energy for the pump)
    into another form of energy (electrical energy).
    <p>Another very common source of electrical power is a generator -
    and it <i>does</i> actually contain spinning moving parts - we'll discuss
    them more in <a data-uid="sources"></a>.
  <h2>Charge</h2>
  <p><mark>PIC: generic drawing or stock photo of a atoms/electrons.
  Animated?</mark>
  <p>Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all matter.  Atoms themselves
  consist of 3 different particles: protons, neutrons and electrons.  In the
  study of electricity, it is the protons and electrons that are of importance
  - they are the charged particles that make electricity possible.
  <p>Protons and electrons have an intrinsic property called charge.  For a
  single proton and electron, the amount of charge is equal but opposite.
  Opposite charges are attracted to one another, while like charges repel each
  other.  Protons have a positive charge, and electrons have an equal but
  opposite (negative) charge.
  <p>In ordinary matter, for example a metal conductor, the positive protons
  stay in a fixed location (the atom itself stays put), while some of the
  electrons are free to drift about the metal.  It is these electrons that are
  responsible for the electric current.
  
  <h2>Conductors</h2>
  <p><mark>PIC: generic drawing or stock photo of wires</mark>
  <p>Conductors are the "pipes" of a circuit.  Conductors are made of materials
  that allow charge to flow freely through them.  In general, this means
  conductors are made out of metal, and copper is one of the most common metals
  used.  Metals are special in that their structure has some "free" electrons
  that are not tightly bound to any specific atom.  Instead, these electrons
  can flow
  freely throughout the metal, and are sometimes refered to as a "sea of
  electrons".
    <p>It's important to note that conductors are
    completely filled throughout with charge.  Analogously, the pipes are fully filled with
    water.  There is no air in the pipes.
  <p>There's some important differences between conductors and pipes that you
  should keep in mind:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Real pipes can leak water.  Conductors cannot leak electrons - the electrons are held too tightly to the metal atoms to escape.
    </li>
    <li><p>Metal conductors allow electrons to flow <i>throughout</i> the
    metal.  Unlike a water pipe, there is no outside part (the pipe) that keeps
    the electrons in, they are held in by the strong pull of the protons in the
    metal atoms.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>On terminology</h1>
  <h2>Voltage, Current & Resistance</h2>
  <p>Voltage, Current & Resistance are three basic measurements that can be
  made in a circuit.  We'll discuss these more in <a data-uid="circuits"></a>,
  but in the following projects, it will be useful to have a rough idea of what
  the are:

  <ul>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Voltage:</strong> The difference in charge between two points
    in a circuit.
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Current:</strong> The flow of electric charge.
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Resistance:</strong> The amount that a circuit component
      reduces the flow of charge.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Power & Ground</h2>

  <p><mark>PIC: Lightbulb circuit with Power Ground and load marked.

  <p>In all circuits, we often talk about the following parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Power:</strong> This is generally the point of highest (most
      positive) charge
      in your circuit -- for example, the positive terminal of your battery.
      This point in a circuit is sometimes generically called "Vcc" or in the
      case of most of the projects we'll be doing, "3.3V" (since the power
      source we'll
      be using will be 3.3 volts). The power source provides the energy that
      makes the circuit do something useful.
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Load:</strong> The part of the circuit that uses the flow of
      charge -- the components in the circuit -- is typically
      referred to as the Load. Above we talked about circuit resistance -- the
      Load is the part of the circuit that provides resistance. An example from
      our earlier circuit would be the lightbulb -- that is a part of the
      circuit Load. The Load uses the energy that the power source
      provides.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Ground:</strong> In an electric circuit, ground is generally
      the point of lowest (most negative) charge in the circuit. For example,
      in our lightbulb circuit above, the negative terminal of the battery is
      the point of
      lowest charge, and would be the physical ground point of this circuit.
      Interestingly, the reason we use the term "ground" is because in many
      electrical applications (like the electricity running through your
      house), the earth is used as both our reference point of lowest charge
      and our physical point of attaching the electrical circuit. This is
      because the earth is able to receive nearly infinite amounts of
      electricity without increasing its total charge, so we can always assume
      that the voltage between a power source and the earth will be
      constant.</p>
      
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      Grounding Yourself
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>In our assembly guide, we mentioned that you should "ground" yourself
      before touching electronic components. Now that you have a conceptual
      idea of what ground is, we can explain this further. Have you ever gotten
      a static shock by touching someone or something? Sometimes, electric
      charge builds up in your body. This charge is then released -- in the
      form of a static discharge (or shock) when you touch someone or something
      that has a different amount of charge. In other words, if there is a
      voltage difference between you and some object, and you touch that
      object, you'll get a shock. Once your body has discharged the excess
      charge, you don't get any more shocks -- until, of course, you build up
      more charge.</p>

      <p>If you were to touch an electrical component when you have a charge
      built up in your body, that resulting static shock that you feel could
      very well be enough to zap the component and break it (we sometimes call
      this "frying the component.") So, to avoid frying any electrical
      components, we recommend that you discharge any excess charge in your
      body before touching the components.</p>

      <p>You can ground yourself by touching any piece of metal that is
      connected via some relatively direct path to the earth. Since all the
      electrical outlets in your house are connected to earth ground, you can
      generally ground yourself by touching the metal case of a electrical
      device that is plugged in. On the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, you can
      touch the metal casing on any of the USB ports or the Ethernet port on
      the back of the Raspberry Pi -- assuming the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit is
      plugged into a wall outlet.</p>
