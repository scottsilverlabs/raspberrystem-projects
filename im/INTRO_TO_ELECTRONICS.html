  <h1>INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS</h1>
  <h2>What is Electricity</h2>
  <mark>Need image or diagram, or cartoon</mark>

  <p>Simply stated, electricity is a flow of charged particles (electrons).
  When charged particles are allowed to flow from one place to another, they
  transfer energy that can be used to power everything from a light bulb to an
  entire city. All of our everyday electronic gadgets – from cell phones to
  computers to microwave ovens – are powered by the flow of these charged
  particles.</p>
  <h2>What is a Circuit</h2>

  <p>A circuit is a closed loop that allows charged particles to flow through
  it. The parts of a circuit that charged particles flow through are called
  conductors -- conductors are the building blocks of circuits, and metal wires
  are one example of a conductor. Wires and other conductors allow charged
  particles to flow through them and when you string together conductors in a
  closed loop, you have created an electric circuit.</p>

  <p>A typical circuit has a power source, conductors, and various other
  components. The power source forces charged particles to flow through the
  circuit. The conductors (wires) connect together the components in the
  circuit. And, the components are the parts of the circuit that are affected
  by the electricity as it passes through them.</p>

  <p>For example, a circuit may contain a battery and a lightbulb, attached
  together with wires. The battery serves as the power source, which forces
  charged particles through the wires. When the charged particles flow through
  the lightbulb, it illuminates.</p>

<mark>Battery lightbulb circuit - animated</mark>

  <p>Some circuits are very simple (like our battery and lightbulb example),
  while other circuits are very complicated, containing many power sources,
  wires and components.</p>
  <h2>The Water Analogy</h2>
  <p>Often, electricy can be a hard to get an intuitive understand of because it
  is invisible.  Electrons (charged particles) flow through wires, but you
  can't see them.  Because of this, it is often helpful to talk of the how the
  flow of electrons through a conductor is very similar to the flow of water
  through a pipe. 
  <p>This analogy isn't perfect, because electrons AREN'T water.  But there are
  many very strong similarities - often so similar that the equations we
  use to describe electricity are essentially the same equations used to
  describe the flow of water.  Most of the electrical concepts throughout the
  Projects Guide use the water analogy to give a simple and intuitive
  understanding of what is going on inside a circuit.  They are powerful and
  helpful, and can allow you to understand what's happining in a circuit
  without any equations.  However, along the way we'll discuss the differences,
  too, so you can see where the analogy doesn't work.
  <p>For example, a simple circuit with a battery is <i>analogous</i> to water
  flowing through a closed loop of pipe:
<mark>resistive circuit - animated, compared to water analogy,
animated</mark>
  <p>But don't do this! If you do, you'll have created a short circuit, which
  we discuss in future projects - and you will quickly drain your battery.</p>
        
        <p>In this example, the Battery/Pump forces Electrons/Water around a
        closed loop (circuit).  You'll notice the analogy between the
        electrical circuit and the water circuit:

  </table>
  <h2>Power Source</h2>
  <p>Power sources provide the energy to make electrons flow in circuits.  There
  are many different types of power sources, and we'll talk more about them in <a data-uid="sources"></a>.
    <p>In our simple circuit above, the power source is a battery.  A battery
    converts chemical enery into electrical energy.  That is, inside a battery,
    a specific chemical reaction occurs that causes electrons to be pulled into
    one side of the battery, and pushed out the other.
    <p>In the water analogy, we model this as a pump - a device that pulls in
    water from pulled into one side, and pushes out the other, similar to a
    battery.
    <p>What's great about this analogy is it is intuitively obvious that
    exactly as much stuff (electrons/water) goes into the power source
    (battery/pump) as comes out.  The power source does not <i>electrons</i>
    and more than a pump creates water.
    <p>However, the water pump is just a <i>model</i> of the battery.  The
    battery does not have any spinning moving parts inside.  Both electrical
    batteries and water pumps are similar in that they convert one form of
    energy (chemical energy for the battery and mechanical energy for the pump)
    into another form of energy (electrical energy).
    <p>Still, another very common source of electrical power is a generator -
    and it <i>does</i> actually contain spinning moving parts - we'll discuss
    them more in <a data-uid="sources"></a>.
  <h2>Conductors</h2>
  <p>Conductors are the "pipes" of a circuit.  Conductors are made of materials
  that allow electrons to flow freely through them.  In general, this means
  conductors are made out of metal, and copper is one of the most common metals
  used.  Metals are special in that their structure has some electrons that are
  not tightly bound to any specific atom.  Instead, these electrons can flow
  freely throughout the metal, and are sometimes refered to as a "sea of
  electrons".
  <p>There's some important differences between conductors and pipes that you
  should keep in mind:
  <ul>
    <li><p>In the water analogy, all pipes is fully filled with water.  There is
    no air in these pipes.
    </li>
    <li><p>Real pipes can leak water.  Conductors cannot leak electrons - the electrons are held too tightly to the metal atoms to escape.
    </li>
    <li><p>Metal conductors allow electrons to flow <i>throughout</i> the
    metal.  Unlike a water pipe, there is no outside part (the pipe) that keeps
    the electrons in, they are held in by the strong pull of the metal atoms.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Electrons</h2>
  <p>Electrons are the charged particles that flow through a conductor, analogous to the water flowing through a pipe.  <mark>basic description of atom/protons/electrons.  note about holes vs electrons</mark>

<div class=section>
  <h1>Voltage, Current & Resistance</h1>
  <p>These three concepts define how and when electric charge flows, and
  controlling these things allows us to harness the power that electricity
  provides. While we can’t actually see voltage, current or resistance, there
  are some analogies we can use to help understand what each of these concepts
  are and how they interact with each other.</p>

    <mark>Battery resistive circuit vs water resistive circuit</mark>
        <p>Similar to the previous example, the Battery/Pump forces
        Electrons/Water around a closed loop (circuit).  But we've now added a
        conscriction to the pipe so we can discuss additional elements of the
        circuit:
  <table style="table-layout: fixed;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th><p>ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT</p></th>
        <th><p>WATER CIRCUIT</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><p>Voltage</td>
        <td><p>Pressure</td>
      </tr>

        <td><p>Resistance</td>
        <td><p>Pipe constriction or obstruction (narrow pipe)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
  <h2>Voltage</h2>

  <p>Voltage is essentially the difference in the amount of charge from one
  point in a circuit to another. An important concept of electricity is that
  charge will typically only flow between two points that have a difference in
  charge (a voltage). Specifically, charged particles will flow from a point of
  higher charge to a point of lower charge. If there is the same amount of
  charge at two points in a circuit, no electricity will flow.</p>

  <p>Using our water analogy, voltage is analogous to the amount of pressure
  (basically, the force) that there is pushing water through a pipe filled with
  water. Imagine a water
  system that contains a water pump that is pushing water around a loop of a
  water-filled pipe (a 'circuit') -- water enters the pump at a low pressure
  and is ejected from the pump at a high pressure. It is this pressure
  difference that generates the flow of water. Likewise in an electric circuit,
  the electric power source is analogous to the water pump -- a power source
  takes in charge at a low voltage and pushes it out at a high voltage. It is
  this difference in voltage on the opposite sides of of the power source that
  generates the flow of charged particles.</p>

    <p>Whenever there is a difference in voltages from one point to another in
    a circuit, and there is a conductive path for the electrons to flow between
    those two two points, the electrons will flow.  This is true for forces in general - if you push someone else, they have to push back with the same amount of force, or else they will move.  The person who pushes with more force continues to move in the direction of that force.

    <mark>TBD: pushing force image</mark>

  <h2>Current</h2>

    <mark>Battery resistive circuit vs water resistive circuit</mark>
  <p>Current is the flow of electric charge through a
  circuit. Using our water analogy, 
  current is the amount of water actually flowing through the
  pipe.  In both cases, its measured by the amount of stuff (electrons or
  water) that flows through the pipe in an amount of time.</p>

    <p>Its important to note that in our simple circuit example above, the
  current is exactly the same at every point in the circuit.  That is, if your
  were to look at any small segment of the circuit, the same amount of
  electrons are going into that segment as are going out.  This is true in the
  battery, the wires, and the resistor.

  <p>If you think about the water analogy, you might realize this must be true.
  If there was any segment of the circuit where there was more water going into
  that circuit than going out, then the pipe would ballon up at that point, or
  burst.  But that doesn't happen - the flow of current happens around the
  entrie circuit all together, in lock step.

  <p>One thing that the water analogy doesn't give a good picture is how fast the elections actually move trhough the circuit.  In a water circuit, you might imagine an actually water molecule moving, say, 1 foot along the pipe each second.  In electrical circuits, the electrons move rought a million times <i>slower</i>.  This may seem weird, as electricity is often viewed as being very fast.  <mark>[Elaborate more but put in info block?  Or just remove?]</mark>

  <h2>Resistance</h2>
    <mark>Battery resistive circuit vs water resistive circuit</mark>
  <p>If a water pipe is contricted (pinched), then less water can flow through it (for a certain water pressure).  This concept is familiar to anyone who has played with a garden hose - if you pinch the hose, less water comes out.  If you pinch the hose hard enough, <i>no</i> water comes out.
