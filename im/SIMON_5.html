<p>In our last project, we created a random sequence of
LED flashes.  We included that code in a loop that will
continue to add another flash to the end of the sequence and replay the
sequence.  This is exactly how our game will work, except that
after playing a sequence, the player will have to repeat the sequence
using the buttons on the breadboard.  If they do it correctly,
we add a new LED to the sequence; if they do it incorrectly, the game
is over.</p>
<p>In this project, we'll add the buttons as input, and add the
code that will verify the button sequence that the player enters.</p>
<h2>Programming Implementation</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1:  Add the
initialization code</p>
<p>The first thing we're going to need to do is initialize the
buttons -- we'll import the function we need and create the button list
just like we did in <a href="MANY_BUTTONS.html">MANY
BUTTONS</a>:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea># Initialize the LEDs and sequence list
from rstem.button import Button

buttons = [Button(14), Button(15), Button(23), Button(17)]
</textarea></div>

<br>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2:  Check the
button sequence entered by the player</p>

<p>Next, we need to add code after we play the sequence to check
for whether the user has entered the correct sequence back.  There are several parts to this, and 
they will all be captured in a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">for:</span> loop that runs through the sequence the player is repeating.  Each time through the<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"> for: </span>loop, we'll need to accomplish the following things:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>First, we test to see if the button pressed was the next button in the
sequence.</li>
	<li><p>If an incorrect button was pressed, we
set a variable called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">failed</span> to True.  This will be our
indication to the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span> loop that the game is over and on our next
pass, we should drop through the loop.  This will also require us
to change our test in the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span>
loop that we already created (we'll do that in Step #3).  And
we'll need to stop checking for additional button presses and drop
through the loop.</li>
	<li><p>Lastly, if the player has entered a correct button in the sequence, we need to flash that LED.</li>
</ol>

	<p>Here is what the beginning of the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">for:</span> loop would look like:</p>

<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea># Wait for user to repeat
for i in play order:
	button_pressed = Button.wait_many(buttons, timeout=3)
</textarea></div>

<br>

<br>
<div class="info">
<div>"wait_many() Function"</div>
<div>
	<p>
	The wait_many() function takes a list of buttons as a parameter, will wait for any of them to be pressed and will then return the index into the buttons list of the button that was pressed. 
	<p>
	See the API reference for more details.
</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>Next, we check to see if player pressed the WRONG button:</p>

<br>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>if button_pressed != i:
	failed = True
	break
</textarea></div>

<br>
<p>If the button entered by the player was incorrect, we set a variable called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">failed</span> to True, and then we <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">break</span> -- the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">break</span> command will immediately exit the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">for:</span> loop.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">If
the button entered by the player was correct</span>, we need to
light the LED before moving on to checking the next
button entered.  Here is what that code should look like:</p>
<br>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea># Light and play while button is pressed.
lights[button_pressed].on()
buttons[button_pressed].wait(press=False)
time.sleep(0.2)
lights[button_pressed].off()
</textarea></div>
<p>
In the code above, we turn the LED on, wait until the button is released, and
turn it back off.  But there's an extra line in there as well - we sleep for a
very short period.  This extends the time the LED is on to give a better
appearance when a player presses and releases a button very quickly. 
</p>

<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"></p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Step #3:  Update
the while loop</p>
<p>Finally, we have to update our <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span> loop, as we want it to
drop through if we determine that the user made a mistake and the game
is over.  Remember, we set a variable called <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">failed</span> to True
when the user made a mistake, so we can simply test to see whether
<code>failed</code> is <code>True</code> in our <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span> loop.</p>
<p>To update the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span> loop, we need to first initialize our
failed variable when we start the program, and then we can update our
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">while</span> loop as follows:</p>
<br>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea># Initialize the LEDs and sequence list
failed = False

...

while not failed:
</textarea></div>

<br>
<p>
Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point -- when you run it,
you will see a single LED flash, and you can press the button associated with that LED; then
the pattern will repeat, adding a new LED light and you can enter the 2-light sequence; the
sequence will continue to add a new LED for as long as you correctly enter the sequence:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
