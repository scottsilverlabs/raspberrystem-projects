<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This section is devoted to running Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi and using the RaspberrySTEM 
to create both hardware and programs that will allow you to modify the Minecraft world, 
control your Minecraft character and create fun games and challenges within Minecraft.
<p>
There are a number of concepts and steps involved in learning to program Minecraft, and 
we will walk through those steps one-by-one over the next several concepts and projects.
In this first project, we will learn how to run Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi and move
back and forth between the Minecraft game and the RaspberrySTEM development environment. 

<h2>The Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Raspberry Pi comes preloaded with a simplified version of Minecraft
tailored to the Raspberry Pi.  It runs in creative mode only and has a custom
API for editing the world.  Both single and multiplayer are supported.  With
the API you can create programs that interact with both your electronics AND
the minecraft world.
</p>

<p>
To get started, you'll need to first go to the Raspberry Pi Desktop by typing
CTRL-ALT-D:
</p>

<p>
Then, you'll open Minecraft from the menu:

<p>
To begin using Minecraft, first click the "Start Game" button:
</p>

<p>
Then create a new world:
</p>

<p>
And you're now playing Minecraft!  The keyboard and mouse will control your
player, Steve.
</p>

<p>
You'll write programs that interact with Minecraft from the RDE.  But before
doing so, minimize the Minecraft window:
</p>
<img src="img/mc_desktop_empty_mc_running.png">
<ul>
<li><p>First press TAB.  This will free the mouse up so that it can be used to
control the mouse cursor.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, click the minimize button in the upper right corner of the window.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Minimizing the Minecraft window is important, because Minecraft Pi has a quirk that 
it always appears to be the top-most window on the screen (unless you minimize it).  
With the Minecraft window minimized, reopen the RDE by clicking on the [RaspberrySTEM] 
tab at the top of the desktop.
</p>
<p>
Now it's your turn to give it a try!  Following the instructions above, open the
Minecraft game and then return back here.  Assuming you were able to accomplish
that, you're ready to start learning how to program Minecraft.
