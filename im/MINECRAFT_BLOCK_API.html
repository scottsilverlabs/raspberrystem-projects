  <h2>Minecraft Block APIs</h2>

  <p>Minecraft and RaspberrySTEM provide a number of APIs that allow us to
  manipulate blocks in various ways. We'll be using many of these APIs in
  upcoming projects, but in the meantime, we wanted to provide a general
  overview of the block functions, how they work and what arguments are
  required to make use of the functions.</p>
  <h3>.getBlock()</h3>.getBlock(x,y,z) "Get block (x,y,z) =&gt; id:int"
  Available on Minecraft: Pi EditionAvailable on RaspberryJuice #retrieves the
  block type for the block at 0,0,0 blockType = mc.getBlock(0,0,0)
  <h3>.getBlocks()</h3>.getBlocks(x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1) "Get a cuboid of blocks
  (x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1) =&gt; [id:int]" Available on RaspberryJuice #get the
  block id's in a cuboid blocks = mc.getBlocks(-1,-1,-1,1,1,1) for block in
  blocks: print block
  <h3>.getBlockWithData()</h3>.getBlockWithData(x,y,z) "Get block with data
  (x,y,z) =&gt; Block" Available on Minecraft: Pi EditionAvailable on
  RaspberryJuice #retrieves a block object for the block at 0,0,0 blockObj =
  mc.getBlockWithData(0,0,0)
  <h3>.setBlock()</h3>.setBlock(x,y,z) "Set block (x,y,z,id,[data])" Available
  on Minecraft: Pi EditionAvailable on RaspberryJuice #sets a block at an x, y,
  z co-ordinate to a particular type mc.setBlock(0,0,0,block.DIRT.id) #sets a
  block to a particular type and 'subtype' mc.setblock(0,0,0,block.WOOD.id, 1)
  <h3>.setBlocks()</h3>.setBlocks(x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,blockType, blockData) "Set
  a cuboid of blocks (x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,id,[data])" Available on Minecraft: Pi
  EditionAvailable on RaspberryJuice #sets many blocks at a time, filling the
  gap between 2 sets of x, y, z co-ordinates mc.setBlocks(-1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1,
  block.STONE.id)
  <h3>.getHeight()</h3>.getHeight(x,z) "Get the height of the world (x,z) =&gt;
  int" Available on Minecraft: Pi EditionAvailable on RaspberryJuice #find the
  y (vertical) of an x, z co-ordinate which represents the 'highest' (non-air)
