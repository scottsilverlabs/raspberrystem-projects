<h2>Minecraft Block APIs</h2>

<p>Minecraft and RaspberrySTEM provide a number of APIs that allow us
to manipulate blocks in various ways.  We'll be using many of these
APIs in upcoming projects, but in the meantime, we wanted to provide
a general overview of the block functions, how they work and what
arguments are required to make use of the functions.

<p>Each block in the Minecraft world has a "type" (what the block is made out of) 
and each type of block can have additional characteristics associated with it 
(the block "data").  For example, blocks with the type "WOOD" can also have
data associated with them that indicate the wood block is made from "Oak," or
"Birch" or "Spruce."  

<p>Note that in Minecraft, everything is made of blocks, including the 
air.  The blocks that make up the air in Minecraft function exactly
the same as all other blocks, but have the specific type of "AIR."  If you
want to "remove" a block from Minecraft, you can change it's type to AIR. 

<p>Here are the most commonly used block-related functions provided in
the RaspberrySTEM API:

<h3>.getBlock()</h3>

<p>The <code>getBlock()</code> function takes the location of a block
(in X, Y, Z coordinates) and returns the type of block at that 
location.

<p>For example, to get the block type for the block at the location
0, 0, 0:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

block_type = mc.getBlock(0,0,0)
print(block_type)
</textarea></div>

<p>See below for the different types of blocks supported in the Minecraft
Pi edition.

<h3>.getBlockWithData()</h3>

<p>The <code>getBlockWithData()</code> function takes the location of a block
(in X, Y, Z coordinates) and returns the type of block at that 
location, along with other characteristics of the block.

<p>For example, to get the block type and data for the block at the 
location 0, 0, 0:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

block = mc.getBlockWithData(0,0,0)
block_type = block.id
block_data = block.data

print(block_type, block_data)
</textarea></div>

<p>See below for the different types of block data supported in the Minecraft
Pi edition.


<h3>.setBlock()</h3>

<p>The <code>setBlock()</code> function takes a location (and optionally a
set of data) and places a block with that data type at the location.

<p>For example, to place a wood block made of Oak at location 0, 0, 0:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

mc.setblock(0,0,0,block.WOOD.id, 1)
</textarea></div>


<h3>.setBlocks()</h3>

<p>The <code>setBlocks()</code> function takes two locations (and optionally a
set of data) and places a cuboid (three dimensional rectangular) set of blocks 
with that data type at all the points between those locations.

<p>For example, to place a set of 125 wood blocks made of Oak in a cuboid with one
corner located at 0, 0, 0 and the farthest corner located at 5, 5, 5:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

mc.setblocks(0,0,0,5,5,5,block.WOOD.id)
</textarea></div>


<h3>.getHeight()</h3>

<p>The <code>getHeight()</code> function takes a two-dimensional x, z location and 
returns the height of the highest block at that location.

<p>For example, to find the height of the highest non-air block at the location
0, 0:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

height = mc.getHeight(0,0)

print(height)
</textarea></div>
