      In this project, we will use GPIOs to get input from a pushbutton into
      our software.

  <p>Before jumping into this project, we very strongly recommend that you read
  <a data-uid="gpioc"></a>, as these
  concepts will be the basis for this project and nearly all future
  RaspberrySTEM projects.</p>

  <p>In the previous project, we saw how GPIOs can be used as outputs to
  control components attached to the Raspberry Pi (like our LED). GPIOs can
  also be used as inputs to take information from external components; that
  input can then be acted upon by the Raspberry Pi and appropriate actions can
  be taken.</p>
  <h2>Reading Buttons Using GPIOs</h2>

  <p>In <a data-uid="gpioc"></a>, we
  introduced the idea of reading button state based on using GPIOs as inputs and
  then provided a schematic for the circuit we'd need to accomplish this. It
  turns out that implementing that circuit on our breadboard is easy. Let's
  give it a try...</p>

  <p>First, we start with an empty breadboard, with power and ground wired from
  the Lid Connector Board, like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Just_Power_bb.png" alt=""> With our breadboard empty, here is how we
  build our circuit and then use code to get input from the button through the
  GPIO:
  <h4>Step #1: Place button on breadboard.</h4>

  <p>We start by placing a button on the breadboard. Remember, it is important
  that the button is oriented correctly -- the two independent sides of the
  button must sit on different connect strips, as follows:</p>
  <table style="margin: auto; width: 70%;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="img/Button_orientation_correct.png" width="285" alt=
        ""></td>
        <td><img src="img/Button_orientation_wrong.png" width="285" alt=
        ""></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>CORRECT</strong></td>
        <td><strong><span style="color: red;">WRONG!!!</span></strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h4>Step #2: Wire one side of the button to a GPIO.</h4>

  <p>Next, we connect one side of the button (it doesn’t matter which one, as
  the internal components of the button are symmetrical) to a GPIO. In this
  example, we’ll connect the button to GPIO14.</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Buttons_with_GPIO_1_bb.png" alt="">
  <h4>Step #3: Wire the other side of the button to ground.</h4>

  <p>Finally, we connect the other side of the button to ground.</p><img class=
  "bb" src="img/Buttons_with_GPIO_2_bb.png" alt="">

  <p>That’s it for the wiring – pretty simple, right?</p>
  <h4>Step #4: Write the code.</h4>

  <p>Now that the circuit is wired, we can write the code to get the GPIO state
  (low or high):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
my_button = Button(14)
print(my_button.is_pressed())
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In this most basic example, we are reading the GPIO a single time (the
  moment the program is run) and we are printing the state of the button at
  that moment. Try running the program a couple times, either holding down or
  not holding down the button at the moment the program is run.</p>

  <p>You may notice that this example is similar to the<a data-uid="gpoutp"></a> 
  example. But in this case, we configure the GPIO as a input instead of an
  output:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>In Line 2: We're configuring GPIO 14 as a button input.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>In Line 3: We're getting the state of the button, and printing it.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>We'll look at these concepts again in more detail in upcoming
  projects.</p>

  <p>To make the program a little more interesting (and convenient!), we can
  insert a loop so that, instead of just reading the state of the GPIO one
  time, we can continually read and print the state of the GPIO for as long as
  the program is running.</p>

  <p>Here’s what that code would look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
import time

my_button = Button(14)

while True: 
        print(my_button.is_pressed())
        time.sleep(0.1)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Run this program and then alternate between pressing and not pressing the
  button. Take a look at the output window – you should see an indication of
  when the button is pressed and when it is released.</p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      "while True:"
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>You may have noticed that we used a new programming concept above:</p>
      <pre>
while True:
</pre>

      <p>We'll discuss exactly how this works in a future project, but for now,
      just know that using this line of code will force the block of code below
      it to be repeated over and over, forever.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When you're done testing your button, you can stop the program by pressing
  the square STOP icon in the upper-left-hand corner of the code window (this
  icon replaced the PLAY icon while the program was running).</p>
