<p>Before jumping into this project, we very strongly recommend that you 
read <a href="GPIO_CONCEPT.html">GENERAL PURPOSE INPUTS/OUTPUTS</a>, as these
concepts will be the basis for this project and nearly all future RaspberrySTEM
projects.</p>

<p>In the previous project, we saw how GPIOs can be used as outputs to control
components attached to the Raspberry Pi (like our LED). GPIOs can also be
used as inputs to take information from external components; that
input can then be acted upon by the Raspberry Pi and appropriate
actions can be taken.</p>

<h2>Reading Buttons Using GPIOs</h2>
<p>In <a href="GPIO_CONCEPT.html">GENERAL PURPOSE INPUTS/OUTPUTS</a>, we 
introduced the idea of reading button state based using GPIOs as inputs and 
then provided a schematic for the circuit we'd need to accomplish this.  It
turns out that implementing that circuit on our breadboard is easy.  Let's 
give it a try...</p>  

<p>First, we start with an empty breadboard, with power and ground wired from 
the Lid Connector Board, like this:</p>

<center><img class="bb" src="img/Just_Power_bb.png"></center>


With our breadboard empty, here is how we build our circuit and then use code to get input 
from the button through the GPIO:</p>

<h4>Step #1:  Place button on breadboard.</h4>
<p>
We start by placing a button on
the breadboard.  Remember, it is important that the button is oriented correctly -- the two independent sides of the button
must sit
on different connect strips, as follows:</p>

<table style="margin: auto; width: 70%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="img/Button_orientation_correct.png" width="285"></td>
<td><img src="img/Button_orientation_wrong.png" width="285"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>CORRECT</strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="color: red;">WRONG!!!</span></strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4>Step #2:  Wire one side of the button to a GPIO.</h4>
<p>Next, we connect one side of the
button (it doesn’t matter which one, as the internal components of the
button
are symmetrical) to a GPIO.  In
this
example, we’ll connect the button to GPIO14.</p>

<img class="bb" src="img/Buttons_with_GPIO_1_bb.png">

<h4>Step #3: Wire the other side of the button to ground.</h4>
<p>Finally, we connect the other side
of the button to ground.
</p>

<img class="bb" src="img/Buttons_with_GPIO_2_bb.png">
<p>That’s it for the wiring – pretty
simple, right?</p>

<h4>Step #4: Write the code.  </h4>
<p>Now that the circuit is wired, we can
write the code to get
the GPIO state (low or high):</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
my_button = Button(14)
print(my_button.is_pressed())
</textarea></div>

<p>In this most basic example, we are
reading the GPIO a single
time (the moment the program is run) and we are printing the state of
the
button at that moment.  Try
running the
program a couple times, either holding down or not holding down the
button at
the moment the program is run.</p>
<p>You may notice that this example is similar to the 
<a href="GENERAL_PURPOSE_INPUT-OUTPUT.html">GPIO AS OUTPUTS (CONTROLLING LEDS)</a>
example.  But in this case, we configure the GPIO as a input instead of an
output:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <p>In Line 2: We're configuring GPIO 14 as a button input.</p> </li>
<li> <p>In Line 3: We're getting the state of the button, and printing it.</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>
We'll look at these concepts again in more detail in upcoming projects.
</p>
<p>To make the program a little more
interesting (and
convenient!), we can insert a loop so that, instead of just reading the
state
of the GPIO one time, we can continually read and print the state of
the GPIO
for as long as the program is running. 
</p>
<p>Here’s what that code would look like:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
import time

my_button = Button(14)

while True: 
	my_button = Button(14) 
	print(my_button.is_pressed())
	time.sleep(0.1)
</textarea></div>

<p>Run this program and then alternate
between pressing and not
pressing the button.  Take
a look at the
output window – you should see an indication of when the button is
pressed and
when it is released.</p>

<div class="info">
<div>"while True:"</div>
<div>
<p>
You may have noticed that we used a new programming concept above:</p>
<pre>while True:</pre>
<p>We'll discuss exactly how this works in a future project, but for now, just know
that using this line of code will force the block of code below it to be repeated over 
and over, forever.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>When you're done testing your button, you can stop the program by pressing the
square STOP icon in the upper-left-hand corner of the code window (this icon replaced the PLAY
icon while the program was running).
