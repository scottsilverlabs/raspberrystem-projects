<h1>IF/ELSE STATEMENTS</h1>
<p>Much of our lives are spent asking
questions in order to
figure out what we should be saying or doing at any given time.  For example, we may ask
our friend, “Is it time
for lunch?”  If the
answer is “Yes,”
we’ll eat lunch… if the answer is “No,” we’ll probably do something else.</p>
<p>As another example, you may ask a
friend, “What would you
like to do today?”  If
he says, “I’d like
to go to a movie,” perhaps you’ll spend some time figuring out what
movie to
see.  But, if he
says, “I’d like to play
in the park,” you probably won’t be eating popcorn in a dark theater
that day.</p>
<p>Programming is very similar – we
often ask a lot of
questions in our software to determine what to do next. 
For example, when you push a button on your
television remote control, it sends a signal to your TV telling the TV
to
change the station or adjust the volume. 
But, what you probably don’t realize is that this works
because several
times per second, the software in your TV is asking, “Did I receive a
signal
from the remote control?”  </p>
<p>Most of the time the answer is “No,”
so the TV software
moves onto something else for short period of time. 
But, if the answer is “Yes” (in other words,
if you were pressing a button on the remote), the TV will then take
action to
determine what button was pressed and then carry out the request.</p>
<p>The most basic way for software to
ask and respond to a
question is by using what is known as an <code>if</code>
statement.  An <code>if</code>
statement asks a True or False
question, and based on the answer, takes appropriate action.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a circuit that
contains a thermometer and
sends the current temperature back to computer. 
And let’s pretend that the current temperature is 95
degrees and that
value is stored in a variable named <code>temperature</code>:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
temperature = 95
</textarea></div>

<p>The software might then use an <code>if</code>
statement to evaluate the
temperature and comment on it if it’s over 90 degrees:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
if temperature > 90:
	print ("Wow, it's hot out there!")
</textarea></div>

<p>Type those three lines into your code
window and see what
happens:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
temperature = 95

if temperature > 90:
	print ("Wow, it's hot out there!")
</textarea></div>

<p>If you run the program, you’ll see
that the computer prints,
“Wow, it’s hot out there!” in your output window. 
In this case, the computer evaluated the
statement (<code>temperature &gt; 90</code>),
determined that the statement was True (the temperature is 95, which is
over
90) and then took the specified action based on the fact that the
statement was True.</p>
<p>What if the statement were False?  For example, like this:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
temperature = 95

if temperature < 90:
	print("Okay, it's not too hot out there.")
</textarea></div>

<p>In this case, the temperature is
still defined as 95
degrees, but this time, we’re asking if the temperature is LESS THAN 90.  The answer to that
question is obviously
False (the temperature is not less than 90). 
And because the statement is False, the action following
the <code>if</code>
statement is not executed, and nothing is printed to the screen.</p>
<p>We typically call the evaluation a
“conditional statement”
and we typically call the action commands after the conditional
statement the
“code block.”  We’ll
be using those terms
from here on out.</p>
<p>Now, let’s discuss some additional
features of conditional statements
and code blocks…</p>
<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
<p>In the above examples, we used the
symbols &gt; and &lt; in
our condition statements.  We
used &gt; to
ask the question, “Is the first value greater than the second value?”  And, we used the symbol
&lt; to ask the
question “Is the first value less than the second value?”</p>
<p>These are just two of several symbols
(we call them
“operators”) that can be used to compare values in a conditional
statement.  Here is
the list of the most common comparison operators:</p>

<div align="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>OPERATOR</strong></p> </td>
<td><p><strong>DEFINITION</strong></p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center"><strong>==</strong></p> </td>
<td><p>Is Equal To?</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center"><strong>!=</strong></p> </td>
<td><p>Is Not Equal To?</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt; </strong></p> </td>
<td><p>Is Greater Than?</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&lt; </strong></p> </td>
<td><p>Is Less Than?</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;=</strong></p> </td>
<td><p>Is Greater Than or Equal To?</p> </td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&lt;=</strong></p> </td>
<td><p>Is Less Than or Equal To?</p> </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Let’s look at some examples…but
first, let’s define a couple
variables to use in our examples:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
my_dogs_age = 4
my_age = 43
</textarea></div>

<p>Now for our examples:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_dogs_age == 4</code> would evaluate as True </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_age != 43</code> would evaluate as False</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_age &gt; my_dogs_age</code> would evaluate as True</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_age &lt; my_dogs_age</code> would evaluate as False</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_dogs_age &gt;= 4</code> would evaluate as True</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_age &lt;= 35</code> would evaluate as False</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Keep in mind that = and ==
are very different
in programming.  The
= sign tells the
computer that we’re assigning the value of one thing (whatever is on
the right side of the = sign) to another
thing (the variable on the left side of the = sign). 
But, the == asks the computer
whether two things are equal, and returns a True (if they are equal) or
a False
(if they are not equal).</p>
<h2>Code Blocks</h2>
<p>In all the examples so far in this
chapter, our code blocks
have consisted of a single line of code. 
For example, in this piece of code:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
temperature = 95

if temperature < 90:
	print("Okay, it's not too hot out there.")
</textarea></div>

<p>our code block was a single print
statement.</p>
<p>But, in many situations, after
evaluating a conditional,
we’re going to want to take action that requires many commands, not just
one.  For this
reason, code blocks can be
any number of commands following a conditional statement.  Our example above could be
changed to:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>
temperature = 85

if temperature < 90:
	print("Okay, it's not too hot out there.")
	print("It's only", temperature, "degrees.")
</textarea></div>

<p>In this example, we have two print
statements in our code
block.  Notice that
both commands are
indented the exact same amount – this is how the computer knows that
all the
lines are part of the same code block. 
It’s very important that you use the same number of spaces
or indents
for every line of the code block, or your code will not function as you
expect
(and may not function at all).</p>
<h2>Compound Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>In some situations, you may find that
you need to have more
complex conditional statements in your code than just a single
comparison.  When
that need arises, we can use compound
conditional statements, which is really just a fancy way of saying that
we can chain multiple comparisons together into a single conditional
statement.</p>
<p>For example, in the previous section,
we used the condition:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
temperature < 90
</textarea></div>

<p>to determine if it was less than 90
degrees outside.</p>
<p>But, what if we didn’t just want to know
if the temperature was
less than 90 degrees – we wanted to know whether the temperature was
between 80
and 90 degrees?  That
would actually
require two different conditions:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
temperature > 80
temperature < 90
</textarea></div>

<p>We can create a compound conditional
statement that will
check both of those comparisons before taking any action, as follows:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
if (temperature > 80) and (temperature < 90):
	print("The temperature is between 80 and 90 degrees.")
</textarea></div>

<p>The <code>and</code>
keyword tells the computer that both statements must be True in order
for the
entire compound conditional statement to be True.</p>
<p>What if we only cared about the
situation where the
temperature was less than 80 degrees or more than 90 degrees?  We can create a compound
conditional
statement to do this as well:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
if (temperature < 80) or (temperature > 90):
	print("The temperature is not between 80 and 90 degrees.")
</textarea></div>

<p>In this case, the <code>or</code>
keyword tells the computer that either one or both of the statements
must be
True in order for the entire compound conditional statement to be True.</p>
<p>Any number or combination of <code>and</code>
and <code>or</code>
keywords can be used to
combine conditional statements.</p>
<h2>IF/ELSE Statements</h2>
<p>In our previous examples, we
evaluated a conditional, and
took action if the result of the evaluation was True. 
But, in many cases, we also want to take
action when the result of the evaluation is False, in addition to when
it’s
True.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps we don’t just
want to let the user know
if the temperature is over 90 degrees, but we also want to let the user
know if
the temperature is under 90 degrees:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
if temperature > 90:
	print("Over 90 degrees -- make sure to wear sunscreen.")
else:
	print("Under 90 degrees today – keep warm!")
</textarea></div>

<p>We use the else: keyword to indicate
what action should be
taken if the conditional statement evaluates to False. 
We are basically telling the computer: 
</p>
<p><i>If the
conditional
statement is True, do this.  Otherwise
(<code>else:</code>),
do that.</i></p>
<h2>ELIF Statements</h2>
<p>There are going to be some cases
where, “If True, do
this.  If False, do
that,” just isn’t
enough to provide the functionality you need. 
</p>
<p>For example, perhaps we want to know
more than whether the
temperature is above or below 90 degrees? 
Perhaps we want to know if it’s below 60 degrees?  Or in the 60s?  Or in the 70s?  Or in the 80s?  Or in the 90s?  Or above 90 degrees?</p>
<p>In the case where you want to test
for many different conditions,
you can use the <code>elif</code>
(“else if”) statement. 
Like this:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
if temperature < 60:
	print("Brrrr…under 60 degrees.")
elif temperature < 70:
	print("Between 60 and 70degrees.")
elif temperature < 80:
	print("Between 70 and 80 degrees.")
elif temperature < 90:
	print("Between 80 and 90 degrees.")
else:
	print("It is over 90 degrees")
</textarea></div>
