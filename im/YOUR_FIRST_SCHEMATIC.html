<h1>YOUR FIRST SCHEMATIC</h1>
<p>In the real world,
building circuits often start with a “schematic” for the circuit.
  Just like a blueprint tells a builder exactly how to build a house,
a schematic tells an engineer how to build a circuit.</p>
<p>A schematic for a
circuit might look something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m4aa427eb.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="244" width="474"><!--Is this public domain or similar?--></p>
<p>Looks pretty
complicated, huh?</p>
<p>But, if you stick
with me through this section, I think you’ll find that, even a
complex looking schematic like that, is really not too difficult to
understand.</p>
<p>Let’s take this
step by step…</p>
<p><b>The Parts &amp;
Their Symbols</b></p>
<p>Schematics use
symbols to represent all the common parts you will find in a circuit.
 The symbols don’t always look like the parts they represent, so
I’ve provided a little cheat-sheet right here:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; line-height: 100%;" align="center">
<img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_d028f08.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="250" width="463"></p>
<p>You may see some
slight variations between how some of these things are drawn, but if
you use the chart above as your reference, you should be able to
figure out these basis components in any schematic.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice
that in some cases, the symbols may contain (+) and (-) signs that
indicate which side of the part is which – for example, which side
of the battery is the positive (+) side and which is the negative (-)
side.  And in some cases, you’ll see a number next to a part
indicating what size of that part to use – for example, a resistor
may have something like “100 Ω” next to it, indicating that the
resistor should be “100 ohm” in size (we’ll talk more about
this later).</p>
<p><b>Connecting the
Parts</b></p>
<p>In a schematic,
you’ll notice that all the parts are attached to each other by
lines.  These lines represent the wires through which power in the
circuit flow. 
</p>
<p>Wiring a circuit is
as easy as attaching the wires to the parts (and to each other) as
indicated in the schematic.  If you can replicate the drawing using
real wires and parts, your circuit will work as expected. 
</p>
<p>Let’s use the
following schematic as an example:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_4512390.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="293" width="484"><!--bri will update all schematic with cleaner version--></p>
<p>Does this look
familiar?  It should – this is a schematic of the circuit we built
in the previous project.</p>
<h2>Closing the Loop</h2>
<p>You probably noticed
in our schematic above that the entire circuit made a loop.  This
makes sense given our definition of a circuit as needing to be a
closed loop for it to work (remember, in an open circuit, electricity
can’t flow).  The electricity starts<!--I think this creates the common misconception that electrons come out (are generated by) of one side of the battery and go into the other (to get destroyed).  The better picture is that electroncs fill the wire and the battery in an unbroken loops, and they are pushed around the loop by the battery.--> at the (+) terminal of the
battery and finishes at the (-) terminal of the battery, also called
the “ground.”</p>
<p><!--I would say something more like: "Circuits generally are connected in many places to the power source.  Because of this..."-->All circuits will
start at a power source and finish at the ground of that power
source.  And in many schematics – like the one we’ve been using
above – the circuit will appear as a closed loop, starting at one
side of the power source and completing at the other side.  And while
this is how circuits work, it’s not always convenient to draw
circuits in a closed loop.  Especially in complex schematics, where
having to draw everything in a loop can make the drawings very
difficult to read.</p>
<p>Which is why
schematics will often separate the two sides of the power source, and
make the schematic simpler to read.  Let’s take a look at how our
schematic above would typically be drawn in the real world:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m62681acf.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="350" width="58"></p>
<p><!--"This schematic is exactly the same as the other schematic, but the power source is not shown.  That means that the schematic ALSO shows a circuit that is a loop - the loop runs through the power source - it's just that the power source is not drawn.  Also, in this schematic, we don't what they power source is: it could be a battery, or a different type of device - all we know that it supplies power to the circuit at 3.3V."-->At the top of the
schematic is the power source – indicated by the “3.3V”.  Just
like in our previous schematic drawing, the power source is connected
to the Resistor, which is then connected to the LED. 
</p>
<p>In this schematic
diagram, the other lead of the LED doesn’t loop back to the power
source, but instead connects to a symbol that represents “ground.”
 In the real world, the circuit would connect back to the (-) side of
the power source (which is ground), but in the diagram, the power and
ground are separated to make the diagram simpler and easier to read.</p>
