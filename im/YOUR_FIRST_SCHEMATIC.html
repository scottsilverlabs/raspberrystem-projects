  <h1>USING THE BREADBOARD</h1>

  <p>When it comes to building circuits in real life, pinching and holding
  wires together with your fingers as we did in the <a data-uid="yfc"></a> project isn't very
  practical.</p>

  <p>When building electronics in real life, we often want to first build
  temporary circuits that are easy to modify -- this lets you "play around"
  with the circuit and work out the kinks in your design; then, once you have a
  temporary circuit that is working exactly the way you want, you can use the
  design as the basis for creating a permanent circuit.</p>

  <p>One of the most common ways of building a temporary circuit involves the
  use of a “breadboard.” The name breadboard stems from the fact that early
  electronics hobbyists would often use the large wooden boards designed for
  rolling out and cutting bread dough to house their temporary circuits.</p>

  <p>The breadboards used to build electronics are often called “solderless”
  breadboards, which can help avoid confusion when talking to your pastry chef
  friends. <big><big>☺</big></big></p>
  <h2>Breadboard Design</h2>

  <p>Breadboards come in many shapes and sizes, but the fundamental components
  of the breadboard will remain the same:</p><img style="max-width: 600px;" src=
  "img/breadboard_example_1.png" alt="">

  <p>We’ll get to the purpose of each of these parts in a moment, but the key
  to a breadboard’s usefulness is how the various areas are electrically
  connected. Those connections are illustrated here:</p><img style=
  "max-width: 600px;" src="img/breadboard_example_2.png" alt="">

  <p>As you can see, each of the two rails consists of two long row of
  connections (a red row in each rail and a blue row in each rail). There are
  spaces between the groups of holes in the rail, but the entire row is still
  electrically connected as indicated. Also note that the two red rows are not
  connected and the two blue rows are not connected – they are denoted in the
  same color only because they serve the same purpose.</p>

  <p>In the center of the board, each vertical column of five holes (shown
  highlighted in green) is electrically connected together. While we only
  highlighted a few columns of five-hole connected strips, in actuality, every
  columns of five holes is a connected strip. It’s important to note that there
  is no electrical connection across the notch.</p>

  <p>If you recall from <a data-uid="electronics"></a>, in order to have a
  closed circuit, electric charge must be able
  to flow from power, through the circuit, to ground. A breadboard makes it
  easy to wire a circuit in this fashion – the rails denote the power and
  ground of the circuit, while the rest of the breadboard provides space for
  your components and the connections between those components.</p>

  <h2>Powering the Breadboard</h2>

  <p>Of course, the circuits you build on your breadboard are going to require
  power to operate. When it comes to providing power to the breadboard (and to
  the circuits on them), there are lots of options.</p>

  <p>In one of our projects, we use a little 3V lithium battery to power the
  breadboard. In the rest of our projects, we power the breadboard from the
  Raspberry Pi, which in turn gets its power from being plugged into a wall
  outlet. Alternatively, if you ever use a breadboard outside of the
  RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, you'll find that there are power supplies built
  specifically for breadboards. And you always have the option of finding your
  own power source (battery, solar cell, AC power adapter, etc) and hooking
  that up to your breadboard as well.</p>

  <h1>YOUR FIRST SCHEMATIC</h1>

  <p>In the real world, building circuits often start with a “schematic” for
  the circuit. Just like a blueprint tells a builder exactly how to build a
  house, a schematic tells an engineer how to build a circuit.</p>

  <p>A schematic for a circuit might look something like this:</p><img style=
  "max-width: 600;" src=
  "img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m4aa427eb.png" alt=""> 
  <!--Is this public domain or similar?-->

  <p>Looks pretty complicated, huh?</p>

  <p>In reality, its pretty straightforward. Let’s look at the parts of a
  schematic step by step…</p>
  <h2>The Parts &amp; Their Symbols</h2>

  <p>Schematics use symbols to represent all the common parts you will find in
  a circuit. The symbols don’t always look like the parts they represent, so
  we’ve provided a little cheat-sheet right here:</p><img style=
  "max-width: 600px;" src=
  "img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_d028f08.png" alt="">

  <p>You may see some slight variations between how some of these things are
  drawn, but if you use the chart above as your reference, you should be able
  to figure out these basic components in any schematic.</p>

  <p>You’ll also notice that in some cases, the symbols may contain (+) and (-)
  signs that indicate which side of the part is which – for example, which side
  of the battery is the positive (+) side and which is the negative (-) side.
  And in some cases, you’ll see a number next to a part indicating what size of
  that part to use – for example, a resistor may have something like “100 Ω”
  next to it, indicating that the resistor should be “100 ohm” in size.</p>
  <h2>Connecting the Parts</h2>

  <p>In a schematic, you’ll notice that all the parts are attached to each
  other by lines. These lines represent the wires through which electric
  current in the circuit flows.</p>

  <p>Wiring a circuit is as easy as attaching the wires to the parts (and to
  each other) as indicated in the schematic. If you can replicate the drawing
  using real wires and parts, your circuit will work as expected.</p>

  <p>Let’s use the following schematic as an example:</p><img class=schematic
  alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit.png">

  <p>Does this look familiar? It is the same circuit from the project <a data-uid="yfc"></a>.</p>
  <h2>Closing the Loop</h2>

  <p>You probably noticed in our schematic above electric charge the entire circuit made a
  loop. This makes sense given our definition of a circuit as needing to be a
  closed loop for it to work (remember, in an open circuit, electric charge can’t
  flow). Conceptually, we can think of the electric charge as flowing through the
  circuit starting at the (+) terminal of the battery and finishing at the (-)
  terminal of the battery, the ground.</p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      How can a loop have a start?
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>Above, we said that we can conceptually think of the electric charge as
      starting at one point and ending at another. The reason we say
      "conceptually" is that, in actuality, the electrons that create
      electric charge already exist at all points in a closed circuit, so the
      electric charge doesn't really start any point. But, since the (+) terminal
      of the battery is the highest point of voltage, it's easy to think of the
      flow starting there in a circuit diagram.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A good way to think about current flow through a circuit is to assume that
  the flow starts at a particular power source and finishes at the ground of
  that power source. And in many schematics – like the one we’ve been using
  above – the circuit will appear as a closed loop, starting at one side of the
  power source and completing at the other side. And while this is how circuits
  work, it’s not always convenient to draw circuits in a closed loop. In
  complex schematics, having to draw everything in a loop can make the drawings
  very difficult to follow.</p>

  <p>This is why schematics will often separate the two sides of the power
  source, with the power source at the top of the schematic and the ground at
  the bottom. This convention makes the schematic much simpler to read (and to
  write when you're the one creating the schematic).</p>

  <p>Let’s take a look at how our schematic above would typically be drawn in
  the real world:</p><img style="width: 184px; height: 414px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png">

  <p>The circuit that this schematic represents is exactly the same as the
  circuit we presented above (the one in the shape of a loop). At the top of
  the schematic is the power source – indicated by the “3.3V”. Just like in our
  previous schematic drawing, the power source is connected to the resistor,
  which is then connected to the LED.</p>

  <p>In this schematic diagram, the other lead of the LED doesn’t loop back to
  the power source, but instead connects to a symbol that represents “ground.”
  In the real world, the circuit would connect back to the (-) side of the
  power source (which is ground), but in the diagram, the power and ground are
  separated to make the diagram simpler and easier to read.</p>
