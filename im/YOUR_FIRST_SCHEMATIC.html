  <h1>YOUR FIRST SCHEMATIC</h1>

  <p>In the real world, building circuits often start with a “schematic” for
  the circuit. Just like a blueprint tells a builder exactly how to build a
  house, a schematic tells an engineer how to build a circuit.</p>

  <p>A schematic for a circuit might look something like this:</p><img style=
  "width: 559px; height: 287px;" src=
  "img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m4aa427eb.png" alt=""> 
  <!--Is this public domain or similar?-->

  <p>Looks pretty complicated, huh?</p>

  <p>In reality, its pretty straightforward. Let’s look at the parts of a
  schematic step by step…</p>
  <h2><strong>The Parts &amp; Their Symbols</strong></h2>

  <p>Schematics use symbols to represent all the common parts you will find in
  a circuit. The symbols don’t always look like the parts they represent, so
  we’ve provided a little cheat-sheet right here:</p><img style=
  "width: 516px; height: 278px;" src=
  "img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_d028f08.png" alt="">

  <p>You may see some slight variations between how some of these things are
  drawn, but if you use the chart above as your reference, you should be able
  to figure out these basic components in any schematic.</p>

  <p>You’ll also notice that in some cases, the symbols may contain (+) and (-)
  signs that indicate which side of the part is which – for example, which side
  of the battery is the positive (+) side and which is the negative (-) side.
  And in some cases, you’ll see a number next to a part indicating what size of
  that part to use – for example, a resistor may have something like “100 Ω”
  next to it, indicating that the resistor should be “100 ohm” in size.</p>
  <h2><strong>Connecting the Parts</strong></h2>

  <p>In a schematic, you’ll notice that all the parts are attached to each
  other by lines. These lines represent the wires through which electric
  current in the circuit flows.</p>

  <p>Wiring a circuit is as easy as attaching the wires to the parts (and to
  each other) as indicated in the schematic. If you can replicate the drawing
  using real wires and parts, your circuit will work as expected.</p>

  <p>Let’s use the following schematic as an example:</p><img style=
  "width: 534px; height: 287px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit.png">

  <p>Does this look familiar? It is the same circuit from the project <a href=
  "YOUR_FIRST_CIRCUIT.html">YOUR FIRST CIRCUIT</a>.</p>
  <h2>Closing the Loop</h2>

  <p>You probably noticed in our schematic above that the entire circuit made a
  loop. This makes sense given our definition of a circuit as needing to be a
  closed loop for it to work (remember, in an open circuit, electricity can’t
  flow). Conceptually, we can think of the electricity as flowing through the
  circuit starting at the (+) terminal of the battery and finishing at the (-)
  terminal of the battery, the ground.</p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      How can a loop have a start?
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>Above, we said that we can conceptually think of the electricity as
      starting at one point and ending at another. The reason we say
      "conceptually" is that, in actuality, the electrons that create
      electricity already exist at all points in a closed circuit, so the
      electricity doesn't really start any point. But, since the (+) terminal
      of the battery is the highest point of voltage, it's easy to think of the
      flow starting there in a circuit diagram.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A good way to think about current flow through a circuit is to assume that
  the flow starts at a particular power source and finishes at the ground of
  that power source. And in many schematics – like the one we’ve been using
  above – the circuit will appear as a closed loop, starting at one side of the
  power source and completing at the other side. And while this is how circuits
  work, it’s not always convenient to draw circuits in a closed loop. In
  complex schematics, having to draw everything in a loop can make the drawings
  very difficult to follow.</p>

  <p>This is why schematics will often separate the two sides of the power
  source, with the power source at the top of the schematic and the ground at
  the bottom. This convention makes the schematic much simpler to read (and to
  write when you're the one creating the schematic).</p>

  <p>Let’s take a look at how our schematic above would typically be drawn in
  the real world:</p><img style="width: 184px; height: 414px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png">

  <p>The circuit that this schematic represents is exactly the same as the
  circuit we presented above (the one in the shape of a loop). At the top of
  the schematic is the power source – indicated by the “3.3V”. Just like in our
  previous schematic drawing, the power source is connected to the resistor,
  which is then connected to the LED.</p>

  <p>In this schematic diagram, the other lead of the LED doesn’t loop back to
  the power source, but instead connects to a symbol that represents “ground.”
  In the real world, the circuit would connect back to the (-) side of the
  power source (which is ground), but in the diagram, the power and ground are
  separated to make the diagram simpler and easier to read.</p>
