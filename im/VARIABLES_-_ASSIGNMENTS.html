<h1>VARIABLES &amp; ASSIGNMENTS</h1>

<p>Variables are one of
the most important concepts in programming, and you will almost
certainly be using them in every useful program you ever write.
Variables are like labels, or names, for the numbers, strings and other
values in your programs.&nbsp; Variables are used
for keeping track of all the facts and figures you use throughout
your code. Variables can be given any name you choose (although
there are some rules to that!). &nbsp; Choosing good variable names
makes it easier to write your code, to change your
code later and to help others understand your code (which is
important when writing code in groups).<!--I changed this section a good bit to change the emphasis, but it still needs work.-->
</p>

<p>The definition of "variable" is something that can vary (change),
and that's what program variables do&nbsp; throughout a program.&nbsp;
To assign a variable a value, you use the equals sign in what is called
an assignment statement, which looks like:</p>


<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div> </div>
<textarea>my_variable = 5
</textarea></div>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">and to change it to a different value, you also use an assignment statement, <br>
</span></p>

<p>The information that
a variable holds could be a number, a phrase, a calculation<!--I understand what your saying - but it doesn't hold a calculation, it holds the result of a calculation, which is different.-->, a list
of information or pretty much anything you want that variable to
hold. </p>

<h2>Variables Can Hold Numbers</h2>

<p>For example, in the
previous project, we calculated the number of seconds in a day by
multiplying the number of seconds in a minute by the number of
minutes in an hour by the number of hours in a day. I we wanted, we
could rewrite that calculation to use variables instead. </p>

<p>Let’s start by
creating a variable called “sec_in_minute” that will hold the
number of seconds in a minute (which is 60):</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
sec_in_minute = 60
</textarea></div>

<p><b>Note:</b> When
naming variables, you can use any combination of uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers and underscore characters (_). The only
rule is that the variable name must start with a letter. It’s good
practice to use variable names that make your code easier to
understand and read.</p>

<p>Now, let’s create
two more variables:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
min_in_hour = 60
hour_in_day = 24
</textarea></div>

<p>It’s probably
pretty obvious (that’s the goal!), but min_in_hour
is the number of minutes there are in an hour and hour_in_day
is the number of hours in a day.</p>

<p>We could now change
the code we did to do our calculation of number of seconds in a day
to the following:</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div> </div>
<textarea>print(sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day)
</textarea></div>

<p>And here is what the
output would look like if you ran that code:</p>


<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>86400
</pre></div>


<h2>Variables Can Hold Other Variables<!--Not sure exactly what to do here, but I would suggest we switch this project  to only: variables can hold numbers and strings (and other things), and how anassignment statements work.

Then, lets do lists as a completely different project.--></h2>

<p>Remember I said
above that variables can hold almost any type of data – that
includes data from other variables. We can take our program one step
further by creating a variable called sec_in_day
and using it to hold our calculation for the number of seconds in a
day:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
sec_in_day = sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day
</textarea></div>

<p>Now, if you want to
output the number of seconds in a day, you can simply print the
number being held by the sec_in_day
variable:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
print(sec_in_day)
</textarea></div>

<p>This is what the
code and output would look like:</p>

<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>86400
</pre></div>


<p>You’re probably
thinking to yourself that using variables took a lot more time and a
lot more code – in fact, your program went from one line to five
lines! But, if someone were to look at your original code:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
print(60 * 60 * 24)
</textarea></div>

<p>They’d have no
idea what it meant or what you were calculating. But, if someone saw
your final piece of code:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
sec_in_minute = 60
min_in_hour = 60
hour_in_day = 24

sec_in_day = sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day

print(sec_in_day)
</textarea></div>

<p>They would very
likely know exactly what was going on in.</p>

<p>Also, while it seems
like we’ve made our code longer and more complicated, we’ve now
made it easier to use our calculations to do additional calculations
if we wanted to. For example, let’s say we wanted to calculate the
number of seconds in a month or a year? </p>

<p>Using the code we’ve
already written, it would be easy to add these calculations. To
determine the number of seconds in a month (assuming a 30 day month),
we can just multiply the number of seconds in a day by 30 – and we
can give the result its own variable:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
sec_in_month = sec_in_day * 30
</textarea></div>

<p>To determine the
number of seconds in a year, we can multiply the number of seconds in
a day by 365:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
sec_in_year = sec_in_day * 365
</textarea></div>

<p>As you can see, but
using variables to hold our first calculations, we make it easier to
do additional calculations. And, if we’re working on a team or in
a group, the entire program is easier for others to follow and
understand.</p>

<p>Let’s put this all
together, and create a program that will calculate the number of
seconds in a day, month and year, and print out the results:</p>

<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>946080000
</pre></div>

<p>The real benefit is that variables can change throughout a program…</p>

<p>The final benefit of
using variables is that, if a variable needs to change, we can change
it in one place as opposed to having to change it in lots of
different places. For example, if scientists decided tomorrow that
there should actually be 61 seconds in a minute, we could change our
first line of code to:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0"><div></div><textarea>
sec_in_minute = 61
</textarea></div>

<p>And all of our code
would now continue to make accurate calculations. If we wouldn’t
have used variables, we would have had to go through our code and
change every instance of 60 to 61 where we were referring to the
number of seconds in a minute.</p>

<p>Of course, we don’t
expect the number of seconds in a minute to change, but there are
plenty of things in this world that do change, and being able to
update your programs quickly and easily when things change is a huge
benefit to programmers.</p>

<h2>Variables Can Hold Strings</h2>

<p>In addition to
holding numbers and calculations, variables can also hold strings. For
example, we could have a variable that holds one of the output
message we’re using above:</p>

<p>
message = ‘Number of seconds in a
day: ’</p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>We could then print
that message to the output, along with our calculation:</p>

<p>
print (message, sec_in_day)</p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Here is what the
code and output would look like using a variable for the text string:</p>

<p><img src="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_70568b2c.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="167" width="612"></p>

<p>Note that because
message is now a variable, we don’t put quotation marks around it.</p>

<h2>Variables Can Hold Lists of Information</h2>

<p>Another common use
of variables is to hold lists of information. These can be lists of
pretty much any type of information, though the two most common types
of lists you’ll likely be using are lists of strings and lists of
numbers.</p>

<p>An example of a list
of strings would be a list containing the names of the months of the
year. To keep things simple, let’s just create a list containing
the first five months; we’ll use a variable called “months”:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">months
= [‘January’, ‘February’, ‘March’, ‘April’, ‘May’]</p>

<p>Notice how the
entire list has brackets [ ] around it and how each of the items in
the list are strings with quotation marks around them.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at
some of the things we can do with that list…</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>We can reference the entire list. For example, let’s say we
wanted to print the whole thing out:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
print (months)</p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>We can reference a single item in the list. For example, let’s
say we wanted to print out the third item in the list (which is,
“March”):</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
print (months[2])</p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Wait! I said we were going to print out
the third item on the list, and
then I had it print months[2]
– that’s not a typo. Computers always start counting lists at 0,
not 1. So, the first item on a list is [0], the second item on a
list is [1] and so on. To get the third item on the item, we
reference it as [2].</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Here
is how the computer sees our list:</p>

<center>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" width="339">
  <col width="96"> <col width="209"> <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" height="17" width="96">
      <p align="center"><b>ITEM #</b></p>
      </td>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="209">
      <p align="center"><b>ITEM NAME</b></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" height="18" width="96">
      <p align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">0</span></p>
      </td>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="209">
      <p>January</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" height="18" width="96">
      <p align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">1</span></p>
      </td>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="209">
      <p>February</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" height="18" width="96">
      <p align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">2</span></p>
      </td>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="209">
      <p>March</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" height="18" width="96">
      <p align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">3</span></p>
      </td>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="209">
      <p>April</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" height="17" width="96">
      <p align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">4</span></p>
      </td>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="209">
      <p>May</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">So,
the third item on our list of months is months[2].</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>We can reference a range of items on the list. For example,
let’s say we wanted to print out items 2 and 3 in the list (February,
March):</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
print (months[1:3])</p>

<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Notice
that we referenced [1:3] to get items 1 and 2. When we reference a
range, the second number is the item where we stop – that item is
not included in the range.</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>We can change an item in the list. For example, let’s say we
wanted to change “February” to “Feb” to make it shorter (and then print
it out to verify that it has been changed):</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
months[1] = ‘Feb’</p>

<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>We can add an item to the list. For example, if we decide that
we want to include June at the end of the list, we can do the following:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
months.append(‘June’)</p>

<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The
.append() that we used above
is called a function. We’ll discuss later how and why this works. For
now, just be aware that there are bunch of ways you can act on a
list (or any variable, for that matter) using what are known as
functions.</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Just like we added an item to the list above, we can also remove
an item from the list. For example, if we decide that we don’t like
April, we can get rid of it from the list:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
months.remove(‘April’)</p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Here is what the
code and output would look like from creating and running this code:</p>

computer now sees this list:</p>
