<h1>VARIABLES &amp; ASSIGNMENTS</h1>
<p>Variables are one of
the most important concepts in programming, and you will 
certainly be using them in every useful program you write.
Variables are like labels, or names, for the numbers, strings and other
values in your programs.  Variables are used
for keeping track of all the facts and figures you use throughout
your code. 
</p><p>Variables can be given any name you choose (although
there are some rules to that!)   Choosing good variable names
makes it easier to write your code, to change your
code later and to help others understand your code.
</p>
<p>The definition of "variable" is something that can vary
(change),
and that's what program variables do  throughout a
program. 
To assign a variable a value, you use the equals sign in what is called
an assignment statement, which looks like:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
my_variable = 5
</textarea></div>

<p>To change it to a different value, you also use another assignment
statement:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
my_variable = 7
</textarea></div>

<p>A variable can be any type of value, including a number, a phrase, the results of a calculation,
or a list.</p>
<h2>Variables Can Be Numbers</h2>
<p>As an example, we'll calculate the number of seconds in a day.  To do do
this, we'll start by creating a variable called “sec_in_minute” that will be
the number of seconds in a minute (which is 60):</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
sec_in_minute = 60
</textarea></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When
naming variables, you can use any combination of uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers and underscore characters (_). The only
rule is that the variable name must start with a letter. It’s good
practice to use variable names that make your code easier to
understand and read.</p>
<p>Now, let’s create
two more variables:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
min_in_hour = 60
hour_in_day = 24
</textarea></div>

<p>
We can now compute (and print) the number of seconds in a day with:
</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
print(sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day)
</textarea></div>

<p>The asterisk ('*') is a multiplication symbol - see the 
	<a href="CALCULATIONS.html">CALCULATIONS</a> project for more information.
</p><p>
Here is what the
output would look like if you ran that code:</p>

<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>86400</pre>
</div>
<h2>Variables Can Be Assigned the Value of Other Variables</h2>
<p>Remember we said
above that variables can be almost any type of data – that
includes data from other variables. We can take our program one step
further by creating a variable called sec_in_day
and using it to be our calculation for the number of seconds in a
day:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
sec_in_day = sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day
</textarea></div>

<p>Now, if you want to
output the number of seconds in a day, you can simply print the
number being held by the sec_in_day
variable:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
print(sec_in_day)
</textarea></div>

<p>This is what the
output would look like:</p>

<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>86400</pre>
</div>

<h2>Variables Can Be Strings</h2>
<p>Variables can also be strings. For example, we could have a variable that
holds one of the output message we’re using above:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
message = "Number of seconds in a day: "
</textarea></div>

<p>We could then print
that message to the output, along with our calculation:</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
print(message, sec_in_day)
</textarea></div>

<p>Here is what the
code and output would look like using a variable for the text string:</p>

<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>Number of seconds in a day: 86400</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that because
message is now a variable, we don’t put quotation marks around it.</p>
