<h1>VARIABLES &amp; ASSIGNMENTS</h1>
<p>Variables are one of
the most important concepts in programming, and you will almost
certainly be using them in every useful program you ever write.
Variables are like labels, or names, for the numbers, strings and other
values in your programs.&nbsp; Variables are used
for keeping track of all the facts and figures you use throughout
your code. Variables can be given any name you choose (although
there are some rules to that!). &nbsp; Choosing good variable names
makes it easier to write your code, to change your
code later and to help others understand your code (which is
important when writing code in groups).
</p>
<p>The definition of "variable" is something that can vary
(change),
and that's what program variables do&nbsp; throughout a
program.&nbsp;
To assign a variable a value, you use the equals sign in what is called
an assignment statement, which looks like:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
my_variable = 5
</textarea></div>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">and
to change it to a different value, you also use an assignment
statement, <br>
</span></p>
<p>The information that
a variable holds could be a number, a phrase, the results of a
calculation, a list
of information or pretty much anything you want that variable to
hold. </p>
<h2>Variables Can Hold Numbers</h2>
<p>For example, in the
previous project, we calculated the number of seconds in a day by
multiplying the number of seconds in a minute by the number of
minutes in an hour by the number of hours in a day. I we wanted, we
could rewrite that calculation to use variables instead. </p>
<p>Let’s start by
creating a variable called “sec_in_minute” that will hold the
number of seconds in a minute (which is 60):</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
sec_in_minute = 60
</textarea></div>
<p><b>Note:</b> When
naming variables, you can use any combination of uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers and underscore characters (_). The only
rule is that the variable name must start with a letter. It’s good
practice to use variable names that make your code easier to
understand and read.</p>
<p>Now, let’s create
two more variables:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
min_in_hour = 60
hour_in_day = 24
</textarea></div>
<p>It’s probably
pretty obvious (that’s the goal!), but min_in_hour
is the number of minutes there are in an hour and hour_in_day
is the number of hours in a day.</p>
<p>We could now change
the code we did to do our calculation of number of seconds in a day
to the following:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
print(sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day)
</textarea></div>
<p>And here is what the
output would look like if you ran that code:</p>
<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>86400<br></pre>
</div>
<h2>Variables Can Hold The Value of Other Variables</h2>
<p>Remember I said
above that variables can hold almost any type of data – that
includes data from other variables. We can take our program one step
further by creating a variable called sec_in_day
and using it to hold our calculation for the number of seconds in a
day:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
sec_in_day = sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day
</textarea></div>
<p>Now, if you want to
output the number of seconds in a day, you can simply print the
number being held by the sec_in_day
variable:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
print(sec_in_day)
</textarea></div>
<p>This is what the
code and output would look like:</p>
<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>86400<br></pre>
</div>
<p>You’re probably
thinking to yourself that using variables took a lot more time and a
lot more code – in fact, your program went from one line to five
lines! But, if someone were to look at your original code:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
print(60 * 60 * 24)
</textarea></div>
<p>They’d have no
idea what it meant or what you were calculating. But, if someone saw
your final piece of code:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
sec_in_minute = 60
min_in_hour = 60
hour_in_day = 24
sec_in_day = sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day
print(sec_in_day)
</textarea></div>
<p>They would very
likely know exactly what was going on in.</p>
<p>Also, while it seems
like we’ve made our code longer and more complicated, we’ve now
made it easier to use our calculations to do additional calculations
if we wanted to. For example, let’s say we wanted to calculate the
number of seconds in a month or a year? </p>
<p>Using the code we’ve
already written, it would be easy to add these calculations. To
determine the number of seconds in a month (assuming a 30 day month),
we can just multiply the number of seconds in a day by 30 – and we
can give the result its own variable:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
sec_in_month = sec_in_day * 30
</textarea></div>
<p>To determine the
number of seconds in a year, we can multiply the number of seconds in
a day by 365:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>sec_in_year = sec_in_day * 365
</textarea></div>
<p>As you can see, but
using variables to hold our first calculations, we make it easier to
do additional calculations. And, if we’re working on a team or in
a group, the entire program is easier for others to follow and
understand.</p>
<p>Let’s put this all
together, and create a program that will calculate the number of
seconds in a day, month and year, and print out the results:</p>
<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>946080000<br></pre>
</div>
<p>The real benefit is that variables can change throughout a
program…</p>
<p>The final benefit of
using variables is that, if a variable needs to change, we can change
it in one place as opposed to having to change it in lots of
different places. For example, if scientists decided tomorrow that
there should actually be 61 seconds in a minute, we could change our
first line of code to:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
sec_in_minute = 61
</textarea></div>
<p>And all of our code
would now continue to make accurate calculations. If we wouldn’t
have used variables, we would have had to go through our code and
change every instance of 60 to 61 where we were referring to the
number of seconds in a minute.</p>
<p>Of course, we don’t
expect the number of seconds in a minute to change, but there are
plenty of things in this world that do change, and being able to
update your programs quickly and easily when things change is a huge
benefit to programmers.</p>
<h2>Variables Can Hold Strings</h2>
<p>In addition to
holding numbers and calculations, variables can also hold strings. For
example, we could have a variable that holds one of the output
message we’re using above:</p>
<p>
</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
message = "Number of seconds in a day: "
</textarea></div>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>We could then print
that message to the output, along with our calculation:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
print (message, sec_in_day)
</textarea></div>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Here is what the
code and output would look like using a variable for the text string:</p>
<p>
</p>
<div class="output">
<div> </div>
<pre>Number of seconds in a day: 86400<br><br><br></pre>
</div>
<p></p><p>Note that because
message is now a variable, we don’t put quotation marks around it.</p>
