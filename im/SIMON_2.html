<p>In
the previous project, we wired up and tested the four buttons we'll be
using for our pattern-matching game.  Now it's time to add
four
LEDs to the circuit from our last project and test those.</p>
<h2>Hardware
Implementation</h2>
<p>We're going to start with the breadboard setup from the
previous project.</p>

<h4>Hardware Step #1: Wire Your First LED Using a GPIO Output</h4>
<p>For
this game that we're building, we'll have four different colored
LEDs, and each LED will be associated with a particular button.
 For
that reason, we're going to want to wire our LEDs in locations where we
can
easily tell which button each LED is associated with.  While
you're welcome to wire the buttons in any locations you choose, our
instructions below will put each LED as close as possible to its
button.</p>
<p>If you recall
from <a href="GENERAL_PURPOSE_INPUT-OUTPUT.html">GENERAL
PURPOSE INPUT/OUTPUT</a>, to wire an LED to a GPIO, the circuit
schematic should look as follows:</p>

<img class="schematic" style="width: 500px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO.png">

<p>
 We've chosen GPIO4 for our first LED.  As
for LED color, it
shouldn't matter which LED color goes with which button, so we've
arbitrarily chosen orange for this one.</p>
<p>Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</p>

<img class="bb" src="img/simon-4but-1led_bb.png">

<p>Keep
in mind that you're going to want to ensure that neither leg of the
LED sits in the same connect strip as a button or another LED.
</p>

<h4>Hardware Step #2: Wire Your Second LED Using a GPIO Output</h4>
<p>We can now wire our second LED.
 We've chosen GPIO18 for this LED and are using a yellow LED.</p>
<p>Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</p>

<img class="bb" src="img/simon-4but-2led_bb.png">

<h4>Hardware Step #3: Wire Your Third LED Using a GPIO Output</h4>
<p>Time to wire our third LED to the bottom button, like just the
previous two.
 We've chosen GPIO24 for this LED and are using a red LED.</p>
<pHere is what your breadboard
should look like:</p>

<img class="bb" src="img/simon-4but-3led_bb.png">

<h4>Hardware Step #4: Wire Your Fourth LED Using a GPIO Output</h4>
<p>It's time to wire our final LED.
 We've chosen GPIO27 for this LED and are using a green LED.
 </p>
<p>Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</p>

<img class="bb" src="img/simon-4but-4led_bb.png">

<p>You'll
notice that we chose to use an extra jumper to attach the LED to the
GPIO -- again, we're going to want to be able to press each of the
buttons in our circuit, so keeping the wires off to the sides as much
as possible is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Congratulations...you've just
finished the wiring for your first game!</p>
<p>Before
we move on to start implementing the game software, we're going to
write some code to verify that the LEDs are all wired
correctly and are working properly.  Like with our button test
code, our LED test code is going to have two
sections -- the first will import the functions we're going to need for
the rest of the code and the second will test each of the LEDs.</p>
<h2>Programming
Implementation</h2><p>To test our LEDs, we'll create a list of LEDs and cycle through turning each
of them on and off.</p><p>Here's what this import
code should look like (this probably looks familiar from earlier GPIO projects):</p>

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div></div>
<textarea>from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

my_leds = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

for led in my_leds: 
	led.on()
	time.sleep(.6)
	led.off()
	time.sleep(.2)

</textarea></div>
