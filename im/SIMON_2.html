<h1>SIMON 2</h1><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span><p class="MsoNormal">In
the previous project, we wired up and tested the four buttons we'll be
using for our pattern-matching game. &nbsp;Now it's time to add four
LEDs to the circuit from our last project and test those.</p><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware Implementation</span></h2><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #1</span>: &nbsp;Wire Your First LED Using a GPIO Output</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For
this game that we're building, we'll have four different colored
LEDs, and each LED will be associated with a particular button.
&nbsp;For
that reason, we're going to want to wire our LEDs in locations where we
can
easily tell which button each LED is associated with. &nbsp;While
you're welcome to wire the buttons in any locations you choose, our
instructions below will put each LED as close as possible to it's
button.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you recall from Project ???, to wire an LED to a GPIO, the circuit schematic should look as follows:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><img style="width: 511px; height: 519px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO.png"><br></span></span></p><br><p>Based
on that, to
implement the LED circuit on the breadboard, we wire one side of the
LED to 3.3V power with a resistor in-between and wire the other side of
the LED to a GPIO.
&nbsp;We've choosen GPIO&nbsp;4 for our first button. &nbsp;As for LED color, it
shouldn't matter which LED color goes with which button, so we've
arbritarily chosen orange for this one.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like:</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-4but-1led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Keep
in mind that you're going to want to ensure that the neither leg of the
LED sits in the same connect strip as button or another LED, as the
components will need to act independently, and we don't want to
inadvertently send (or receive) signals to a component while trying to
control another component.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #2</span>: &nbsp;Wire Your Second LED Using a GPIO Output</p><p>We can now wire our second LED.
&nbsp;We've choosen GPIO 16 for this LED and are using a yellow LED.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-4but-2led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #3</span>: &nbsp;Wire Your Third LED Using a GPIO Output</p><p>Time to wire our third LED to the bottom button, like just the previous two.
&nbsp;We've choosen GPIO 23 for this LED and are using a red LED.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-4but-3led_bb.png"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #4</span>: &nbsp;Wire Your Fourth LED Using a GPIO Output</p><p>It's time to wire our final LED.
&nbsp;We've choosen GPIO 27 for this LED and are using a green LED. &nbsp;</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard should look like:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 818px; height: 594px;" alt="" src="img/simon-4but-4led_bb.png"></p>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"><br></span><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">You'll
notice that we chose to use an extra jumper to attach the LED to the
GPIO -- again, we're going to want to be able to press each of the
buttons in our circuit, so keeping the wires off to the sides as much
as possible is highly recommended.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Congratulations...you've just finished the wiring for your first game!</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Before
we move on to start implementing the game software, we're going to
write some code to verify that the LEDs are all wired
correctly and are working properly. &nbsp;Like with our button test code, our LED test code is going to have two
sections -- the first will import the functions we're going to need for
the rest of the code and the second will test each of the LEDs.</span></p><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Programming Implementation</span></h2><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Code Section #1</span>: &nbsp;Import Needed Functions</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
first part of our code is going to import the libraries and functions
we'll use later in our code. &nbsp;For this test code, we're going to need
two functions:</span></p><ol><li><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Output() function from the rstem.gpio library</span></p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The sleep() function from the time library</span></p></li></ol><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To
make our code more readable, we'll pull in just the Output() function
from the rstem.gpio library (that way we won't have to type
rstem.gpio.Output() every time we want to call the function); and we'll
pull in the entire time library (so we'll need to call time.sleep()
each time we want to use that function).</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's what this introductory code should look like:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">INSERT CODE</span></p><p>import
rstem</p>
<p>from
rstem.gpio import Output</p>
<p>import
time</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Code Section #2: &nbsp;Test LEDs</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To test the LEDs, we'll assign each one to its own variable, turn each on for 3 seconds and then turn each off.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's what the LED test code should look like:</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">INSERT CODE</span></p><p>light1
= Output(4)</p>

<p>light2
= Output(4)</p>

<p>light3
= Output(4)</p>

<p>light4
= Output(4)</p>

<p>light1.on()</p>
<p>light2.on()</p>
<p>light3.on()</p>
<p>light4.on()</p>
<p>time.sleep(3)</p>
<p>light1.off()</p><p>light2.off()</p><p>light3.off()</p><p>light4.off()</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"></p><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><h2>Executing Your Code</h2><p>Let's
run your code. &nbsp;The first thing you should (hopefully) notice is that all of the
LEDs should immediately illuminate for three seconds, and then turn
off. &nbsp;</p><p>If any of your LEDs don't illuminate when you run the program, you should first verify that your code was entered correctly....</p><p></p><p class="nextprev"><a href="SIMON_1.html">prev</a> |
