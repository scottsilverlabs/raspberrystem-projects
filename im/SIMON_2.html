      <p>In this project, we continue the development of our Simon-like pattern
      matching game by adding the LEDs to our circuit.

  <p>In the previous project, we wired up and tested the four buttons we'll be
  using for our pattern-matching game. Now it's time to add four LEDs to the
  circuit from our last project and test those.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>We're going to start with the breadboard setup from the previous
  project.</p>
  <h3 class=step>Wire Your First LED Using a GPIO Output</h3>

  <p>For this game that we're building, we'll have four different colored LEDs,
  and each LED will be associated with a particular button. For that reason,
  we're going to want to wire our LEDs in locations where we can easily tell
  which button each LED is associated with. While you're welcome to wire the
  buttons in any locations you choose, our instructions below will put each LED
  as close as possible to its button.</p>

  <p>If you recall from <a data-uid="gpoutp"></a>, to wire an LED to a GPIO, the circuit
  schematic should look as follows:</p><img class="schematic" style=
  "width: 500px;" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO.png" alt="">

  <p>We've chosen GPIO4 for our first LED. As for LED color, it shouldn't
  matter which LED color goes with which button, so we've arbitrarily chosen
  orange for this one.</p>

  <p>Here is what your breadboard should look like:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/simon-4but-1led_bb.png" alt="">

  <p>Keep in mind that you're going to want to ensure that neither leg of the
  LED sits in the same connect strip as a button or another LED.</p>
  <h3 class=step>Wire Your Second LED Using a GPIO Output</h3>

  <p>We can now wire our second LED. We've chosen GPIO18 for this LED and are
  using a yellow LED.</p>

  <p>Here is what your breadboard should look like:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/simon-4but-2led_bb.png" alt="">
  <h3 class=step>Wire Your Third LED Using a GPIO Output</h3>

  <p>Time to wire our third LED to the bottom button, like just the previous
  two. We've chosen GPIO24 for this LED and are using a red LED.</p>

  <p>Here is what your breadboard should look like:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/simon-4but-3led_bb.png" alt="">
  <h3 class=step>Wire Your Fourth LED Using a GPIO Output</h3>

  <p>It's time to wire our final LED. We've chosen GPIO27 for this LED and are
  using a green LED.</p>

  <p>Here is what your breadboard should look like:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/simon-4but-4led_bb.png" alt="">

  <p>You'll notice that we chose to use an extra jumper to attach the LED to
  the GPIO -- again, we're going to want to be able to press each of the
  buttons in our circuit, so keeping the wires off to the sides as much as
  possible is highly recommended.</p>

  <p>Congratulations...you've just finished the wiring for your first game!</p>

  <p>Before we move on to start implementing the game software, we're going to
  write some code to verify that the LEDs are all wired correctly and are
  working properly. Like with our button test code, our LED test code is going
  to have two sections -- the first will import the functions we're going to
  need for the rest of the code and the second will test each of the LEDs.</p>
  <h2>Programming Implementation</h2>

  <p>To test our LEDs, we'll create a list of LEDs and cycle through turning
  each of them on and off.</p>

  <p>Here's what this import code should look like (this probably looks
  familiar from earlier GPIO projects):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

my_leds = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

for led in my_leds: 
        led.on()
        time.sleep(.6)
        led.off()
        time.sleep(.2)

</textarea>
  </div>
