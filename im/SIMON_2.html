<h1>SIMON 2</h1>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span>
<p class="MsoNormal">In
the previous project, we wired up and tested the four buttons we'll be
using for our pattern-matching game. &nbsp;Now it's time to add
four
LEDs to the circuit from our last project and test those.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware
Implementation</span></h2>
<p>We're going to start with the breadboard setup from the
previous project, and add the following...</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #1</span>:
&nbsp;Wire Your First LED Using a GPIO Output</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For
this game that we're building, we'll have four different colored
LEDs, and each LED will be associated with a particular button.
&nbsp;For
that reason, we're going to want to wire our LEDs in locations where we
can
easily tell which button each LED is associated with. &nbsp;While
you're welcome to wire the buttons in any locations you choose, our
instructions below will put each LED as close as possible to it's
button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you recall
from <a href="GENERAL_PURPOSE_INPUT-OUTPUT.html">General
Purpose Input/Output</a>, to wire an LED to a GPIO, the circuit
schematic should look as follows:</span></p>
<img class=schematic width=400px src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO.png">
<br>
<p>Based
on that, to
implement the LED circuit on the breadboard, we wire one side of the
LED to 3.3V power with a resistor in-between and wire the other side of
the LED to a GPIO.
&nbsp;We've chosen GPIO15 for our first LED. &nbsp;As
for LED color, it
shouldn't matter which LED color goes with which button, so we've
arbitrarily chosen orange for this one.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</span></p>
<img class=bb src="img/simon-4but-1led_bb.png">
<p>Keep
in mind that you're going to want to ensure that the neither leg of the
LED sits in the same connect strip as button or another LED, as the
components will need to act independently, and we don't want to
inadvertently send (or receive) signals to a component while trying to
control another component.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #2</span>:
&nbsp;Wire Your Second LED Using a GPIO Output</p>
<p>We can now wire our second LED.
&nbsp;We've chosen GPIO18 for this LED and are using a yellow LED.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<img class=bb src="img/simon-4but-2led_bb.png">
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #3</span>:
&nbsp;Wire Your Third LED Using a GPIO Output</p>
<p>Time to wire our third LED to the bottom button, like just the
previous two.
&nbsp;We've chosen GPIO23 for this LED and are using a red LED.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<img class=bb src="img/simon-4but-3led_bb.png">
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Hardware </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Step #4</span>:
&nbsp;Wire Your Fourth LED Using a GPIO Output</p>
<p>It's time to wire our final LED.
&nbsp;We've chosen GPIO27 for this LED and are using a green LED.
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here is what your breadboard
should look like:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<img class=bb src="img/simon-4but-4led_bb.png">
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">You'll
notice that we chose to use an extra jumper to attach the LED to the
GPIO -- again, we're going to want to be able to press each of the
buttons in our circuit, so keeping the wires off to the sides as much
as possible is highly recommended.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Congratulations...you've just
finished the wiring for your first game!</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Before
we move on to start implementing the game software, we're going to
write some code to verify that the LEDs are all wired
correctly and are working properly. &nbsp;Like with our button test
code, our LED test code is going to have two
sections -- the first will import the functions we're going to need for
the rest of the code and the second will test each of the LEDs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Programming
Implementation</span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,serif;">Code Section #1</span>:
&nbsp;Import Needed Functions</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
first part of our code is going to import the libraries and functions
we'll use later in our code. &nbsp;For this test code, we're going
to need
two functions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
Output() function from the rstem.gpio library</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
sleep() function from the time library</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To
make our code more readable, we'll pull in just the Output() function
from the rstem.gpio library (that way we won't have to type
rstem.gpio.Output() every time we want to call the function); and we'll
pull in the entire time library (so we'll need to call time.sleep()
each time we want to use that function).</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's what this import
code should look like:</span></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time
</textarea></div>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Code Section #2:
&nbsp;Test LEDs</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To
test an LED, we'll initialize it just like we did in <a href="GENERAL_PURPOSE_INPUT-OUTPUT.html">General Purpose
Input Output</a>, and we can then illuminate the LED for 2
seconds before turning it off again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's what the&nbsp;LED
test code
should look like for one of the LEDs:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
led1 = Output(4)
led1.on()
time.sleep(2)
led1.off()
</textarea></div>
<p>If you replicate that code for each of the LEDs&nbsp;,
you can test each of the LEDs in your circuit.
&nbsp;Just like for the previous project where we wired and tested
the buttons, this code will be useful later if, after adding more
components to your circuit, you find that the code isn't working
properly. &nbsp;Using this code will allow you to test the LEDs
independently of the other components.</p>
<h2>Executing Your Code</h2>
<p>Here is what your full set of LED test code should look like
at this
point:</p>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
led1 = Output(15)
led2 = Output(18)
led3 = Output(23)
led4 = Output(27)
led1.on()
led2.on()
led3.on()
led4.on()
time.sleep(2)
led1.off()
led2.off()
led3.off()
led4.off()
</textarea></div>
<p>Let's
run your code. &nbsp;You should see all your
LEDs immediately illuminate for three seconds, and then turn
off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If any of your LEDs don't illuminate when you run the program,
you should both verify that your circuit is wired correctly and also
verify that your code was entered correctly.</p>
