<H1>WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?  WHAT IS ELECTRONICS?</H1>
<P>The RaspberrySTEM is
a kit geared towards teaching programming and electronics.  Before we
go any further, it’s important to discuss what “programming” is
and what “electronics” are – as well as to discuss why learning
programming and electronics are important skills.</P>
<P>Let’s start with
the seemingly simple question – What is a computer?</P>

<P>Sometimes you’ll

instructions with detailed diagrams, mistakes are going to happen
(even seasoned engineers make lots of mistakes!).  
</P>
<P>When something in
your project isn’t working correctly, there are steps you can take
to try to determine where the problem is and how to fix it.  This is
referred to as “debugging” your project, and the rest of this
