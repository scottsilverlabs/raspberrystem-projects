  <h1>USING FUNCTIONS &amp; MODULES</h1>

  <p>The other concepts on functions (<a href="INTRO_TO_FUNCTIONS.html">INTRO
  TO FUNCTIONS</a>, <a href="FUNCTION_INPUTS.html">FUNCTION INPUTS</a>, and
  <a href="FUNCTION_OUTPUTS.html">FUNCTION OUTPUTS</a>) discussed how you can
  write and use your own functions. This concept discusses how you can use
  OTHER PEOPLE'S functions to make your code much more powerful.</p>

  <p>While you may not have realized it, you've already used several functions
  that other people have written. Some of those functions are included in the
  Python programming language that everyone (at least everyone who uses Python)
  has access to. For example, when you use the command <code>print()</code>,
  you are actually calling a function named "print" that comes standard with
  the Python language. You may think that <code>print()</code> requires just a
  single line of code, but what you don't see behind-the-scenes is that the
  <code>print()</code> function utilizes <code>thousands</code> of lines of
  code. You read that correctly -- every time you use <code>print()</code>,
  Python is running thousands of lines of code. But, because Python provides
  this command as a function, you can print output using a single programming
  line.</p>

  <p>Now, in addition to thousands of functions that are provided as part of
  Python programming language, you also have access to the RaspberrySTEM API --
  a set of functions that we (the RaspberrySTEM team) have written to make
  building with and using the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit easier and more
  functional. For example, you might see the following in one of our
  projects:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
my_led = Output(14)
my_led.on()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Both of those lines of code are calling RaspberrySTEM functions that we
  have written to make using the RaspberrySTEM easier and more powerful. While
  you only needed to write two lines of code to setup the GPIO and turn on the
  LED, behind the scenes, there were over 300 lines of code that the
  RaspberrySTEM team has written to handle those tasks. Not to mention, within
  those 300+ lines of code, we were calling functions that other people had
  written that accounted for many thousands more lines of code!</p>

  <p>And again, you were able to utilize all that code by writing just a single
  line.</p>
  <h2>Built-In Commands and Importing Functions/Modules</h2>

  <p>In our <a href="INTRO_TO_FUNCTIONS.html">INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS</a>
  lesson, you saw how functions could be included in the same file as the rest
  of your program. But, many times, functions are separated into their own
  files. These files are called modules, and a module will generally contain
  many functions all related to a common task.</p>

  <p>In Python, there are two specific ways functions are used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Built-In Commands:</strong> Some functions can be called
      anytime, anywhere in your code without having to do anything other than
      calling the function. These are referred to as "built-in" functions, and
      the <code>print()</code> function is a good example. We can use the
      <code>print()</code> function anywhere in our code without having to do
      anything other than calling the <code>print()</code> function.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Importing Functions/Modules:</strong> For non-built-in
      functions that we want to use (including all the RaspberrySTEM functions
      we provide), we need to tell the computer that we are going to want
      access to the function(s) before we can use them. We do this by
      "importing" the function or the whole module into our code before we can
      call those functions. There are two common ways of importing functions
      into your code, which we discuss below.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Importing an Entire Module</h2>

  <p>If you're going to be using several functions within the same module, it's
  generally easiest to just import a module into your code. Doing this gives
  you access to any of the functions in that module any time you need them. We
  do this using the "import" command, and a good example that you've probably
  already seen is:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
import time
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The module "time" contains functions for telling time, formatting time
  strings, working with time zones, etc. One function from the time module that
  we frequently use in our projects is <code>sleep()</code>. By importing that
  module, we now have access to all the functions within that module.</p>

  <p>We now have access to the <code>sleep()</code> function by calling:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="2">
    <textarea>
time.sleep(10)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The function call above would sleep (pause) for 10 seconds.</p>
  <h2>Importing Individual Functions From a Module</h2>

  <p>In some cases, we don't need access to all the functions within a module
  -- we only need access to one or two. It's often convenient to import only
  the functions we need, directly by name. When we import in this way, we can
  directly use the function without prefacing it with the module name. For
  example, here is equivalent code to sleep for 10 seconds:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
from time import sleep
sleep(10)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Throughout the projects, we'll be using a lot of functions. We'll make
  sure to point them out as we're using them, and hopefully you can begin to
  get an idea of how powerful functions and modules can be when writing complex
  code.</p>
