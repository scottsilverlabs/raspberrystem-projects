<h1>USING FUNCTIONS &amp; MODULES</h1>
<p>The last couple projects discussed many of the important
aspects of
functions and how you can write functions to make your code easier to
write, easier to read and more reusable. &nbsp;This project is
going to
discuss how you can use OTHER PEOPLE'S functions to make your code much
more powerful.</p>
<p>While you may not have realized it, you've already
used several functions that other people have written. &nbsp;Some
of
those functions are included in the Python programming language that
everyone (at least everyone who uses Python) has access to.
&nbsp;For
example, when you use the command <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">print()</span>,
you are actually calling a
function named "print" that comes standard with the Python language.
&nbsp;You may think that <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">print()</span>
requires just a single line of code,
but what you don't see behind-the-scenes is that the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">print()</span>
function utilizes <span style="font-style: italic;">thousands</span>
of lines of code. &nbsp;You read that correctly -- every time you
use <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">print()</span>,
Python is running thousands of lines of code. &nbsp;But,
because Python provides this command as a function, you can print
things to output using a single programming line.</p>
<p>Now, in
addition to hundreds of functions that are provided by the Python
programming language, you also have access to many dozens of functions
that we (the RaspberrySTEM team) have written to make building with and
using the RaspberrySTEM kit easier and more functional. For
example, you might see the following in one of our projects:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
led = rstem.gpio.Output(14)
led.on()
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Both
of
those lines of code are calling RaspberrySTEM functions that we have
written to make using the RaspberrySTEM easier and more powerful.
While you only needed to write two lines of code to setup the
GPIO and turn on the LED, behind the scenes, there were over 300 lines
of
code that the RaspberrySTEM team has written to handle those tasks. Not
to mention, within those 300+ lines of code, we were calling functions
that other people had written that accounted for many hundreds more
lines of code!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And again, you were able to utilize all that code by writing
just a single line.</p>
<h2>Built-In Commands and Importing Functions/Modules</h2>
<p>In our <a href="INTRO_TO_FUNCTIONS.html">Introduction
to Functions</a> lesson, you saw how functions
could be included in the same file as the rest of your program.
&nbsp;But,
many times, functions are separated into their own files.
&nbsp;These files
are called modules, and a module will generally contain many functions
all related to a common task. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Python, there are two specific ways functions are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Built-In
Commands:</span> &nbsp;Some functions can be called anytime,
anywhere in your code
without having to do anything other than calling the function.
&nbsp;These
are referred to as "built-in" functions or "commands", and the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">print()</span>
function is a
good example. &nbsp;We can use the print() function anywhere in our
code
without having to do anything other than calling the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">print()</span>
function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Importing
Functions/Modules:</span>
&nbsp;For non-built-in functions that we want to use (including all
the
RaspberrySTEM functions we provide), we need
to tell the computer that we are going to want access to the
function(s) before we can&nbsp;use them. &nbsp;We do this by
"importing" the function or the whole module into our code before we
can call those functions. &nbsp;There are two common ways of
importing
functions into your code, which we discuss below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Importing an Entire Module</h3>
<p>If
you're going to be using several functions within the same module, it's
generally easiest to just import an entire module into your code.
&nbsp;Doing this gives you access to any of the functions in that
module any time you need them. &nbsp;We do this using the "import"
command, and a good example that you've already seen is as follows:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
import rstem
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>The
module "rstem" contains all of the functions that we provide specially
for the RaspberrySTEM kit projects. &nbsp;By importing that entire
module, we now have access to all the functions within that module.
&nbsp;As an example, within that module is a set of functions
called
"gpio" functions, and within the set of "gpio" functions is a specific
function called&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Output()</span>.
&nbsp;If you recall from our GPIO project,
this function is used to&nbsp;configure a GPIO as an output.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we import the entire rstem module, we can get access to
the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Output()</span>
function by calling:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
rstem.gpio.Output()
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>And
because the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Output()</span>
function takes a single input (the GPIO number we
are using), we'll call the function using that single function input.
&nbsp;In our GPIO project, we were using GPIO14, so to set that
GPIO to
be used as an output, we used the following:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
rstem.gpio.Output(14)
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>Because
we imported the entire rstem module, we could just as easily call any
of the other functions in that module using a similar approach.</p>
<h3>Importing Individual Functions From a Module</h3>
<p>In
some cases, we don't need access to all the functions within a module
-- we only need access to one or two. &nbsp;While we could still
import
the entire module, there are some situations where importing just the
one or two functions we want access to makes more sense. &nbsp;For
example, let's say that we only needed access to one function in the
rstem module (we can stick with the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Output()</span>
function that we've been
using).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To import just a single function from a module, we
use the "from...import" command. &nbsp;For example, to import just
the
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Output()</span>
function from the rstem module, we would do the following:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
from rstem.gpio import Output
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>One
of the big benefits of importing this specific function (as opposed to
the entire module) is that we can now call the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Output()</span>
function using
the following command:</p>
<br>
<div class="code" data-firstline="0">
<div></div>
<textarea>
Output(14)
</textarea></div>
<br>
<p>You probably noticed
that calling that function now requires a whole lot less typing than it
did above when we imported the entire module. &nbsp;That's the
tradeoff
-- by importing the entire module, you have access to all the functions
in the module, but by importing a single function, it requires a lot
less information to call that function in your code.</p>
<p>Throughout
the projects, we'll be using a lot of functions.
&nbsp;We'll make sure to point them out as we're using them, and
hopefully you can begin to get an idea of how powerful functions and
modules can be when writing complex code.</p>
