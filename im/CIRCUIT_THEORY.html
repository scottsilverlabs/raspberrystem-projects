  <h1>Voltage, Current & Resistance</h1>
  <p>These three concepts define how and when electric charge flows, and
  controlling these things allows us to harness the power that
  electricity
  provides. While we can’t actually see voltage, current or resistance, there
  are some analogies we can use to help understand what each of these concepts
  are and how they interact with each other.</p>

    <mark>PIC: Battery resistive circuit vs water resistive circuit</mark>
    <p>Similar to the previous example, the Battery/Pump forces
    Electrons/Water around a closed loop (circuit).  But we've now added a
    constriction (narrowing) to the pipe so we can discuss additional elements
    of the circuit:

  <h2>Voltage</h2>

  <mark>PIC: Battery vs water circuits, with low/high voltage/pressure highlighted</mark>
  <p>Voltage is essentially the difference in the amount of charge from one
  point in a circuit to another. An important electrical concept is that
  charge will typically only flow between two points that have a difference in
  charge (a voltage). Specifically, charged particles will flow from a point of
  higher (more positive) charge to a point of lower (more negative) charge. If
  there is the same amount of
  charge at two points in a circuit, no electric charge will flow.</p>

  <p>Using our water analogy, voltage is analogous to the amount of pressure
  (basically, the force) that there is pushing water through a pipe filled with
  water. Imagine a water system that contains a water pump that is pushing
  water around a loop of a water-filled pipe (a 'circuit') -- water enters the
  pump at a low pressure and is forced out of the pump at a high pressure. It
  is this pressure difference that makes the water flow. Likewise in an
  electric circuit, the electric power source is analogous to the water pump --
  a power source takes in charge at a low voltage and pushes it out at a high
  voltage. It is this difference in voltage on the opposite sides of the
  power source that makes the charged particles flow.</p>

<p>Finally, voltage are (virtually) always talked about between two points.
That is, we always discuss a voltage <i>difference</i> between those two
points.  For example, if you've ever measured the voltage of a battery, you
know that have to measure the voltage <i>difference</i> between the negative
and positive sides.  However, it is generally common to just discuss voltages
at a single point in a circuit.  This is because it is <i>assumed</i> that you
are asking for the voltage difference between that point and <i>ground</i>,
which is generally the lowest point of volatge in a circuit.

<p>Voltage is measured in "volts", which are named after the Italian physicist
Alessandro Volta, who was one of the first inventors of a rudimentary battery
around 1800.

  <h2>Current</h2>

    <mark>PIC: Battery vs water circuits, with constant current highlighted</mark>
  <p>Current is the flow of electric charge through a
  circuit. Using our water analogy, 
  current is the amount of water actually flowing through the
  pipe.  In both cases, its measured by the amount of stuff (charge or
  water) that flows through the pipe in an amount of time.</p>

    <p>Its important to note that in our simple circuit example above, the
  current is exactly the same at every point in the circuit.  That is, if your
  were to look at any small segment of the circuit, the same amount of
  charge is going into that segment as is going out.  This is true in the
  battery, the wires, and the resistor.  

  <p>If you think about the water analogy, you might realize this must be true.
  If there was any segment of the circuit where there was more water
  continuouslly going into that segment than going out, then the pipe would
  ballon up at that point, or
  burst.  But that doesn't happen - the flow of current happens around the
  entrie circuit all together, in lock step.

<p>Current is measured in "amperes" ("amps", for short), which are named after
the French physicist André-Marie Ampère, who researched electrical current and other phenomenon in the 1800s.

      Negative current?
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>Benjamin Franklin is generally credited with defining the "positive"
    and "negative" values of charge.  Unfortunately, he did so more than 200
    years before the discovery of the electron.  In other words, he didn't know
    what charge physically was, and in fact refered to it as the "electrical
    fluid".  It turns out, you can understand many of the concepts of
    electricity without knowing the details of the physical particles that carry
    charge.  In fact, you can think of circuits as having positive charges that
    flow in one direction, or negative charges that flow the opposite direction
    - the result is the same.
      <p>Franklin made the arbitrary choice to define current as the flow of
      positive charges from a positive voltage to a negative voltage.  That is
      the same definition that we use today, and we call it "conventional
      current".  However, we now know that the particles that actually move are
      the negatively charged electrons, and they flow from negative to positive
      voltage.
    <p>The thing to remember is that conventional current flows in the equal
    but opposite direction as electron current flows.  And when engineers,
    teachers, and electricians say just "current", they mean "conventional
    current".  
    <p>One additional unfortunate twist: physicists like to use "current" to
    mean "electron current", and so physicists have a backwards convention
    compared to everyone else.  But, unless you become a physicist, you can
    just ignore that!
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Resistance</h2>
    <mark>PIC: Labelled water/pump/narrowing resistance circuit</mark>
  <p>If a water pipe is constricted (narrow), then less water can flow through
  it (for a certain water pressure).  This concept is familiar to anyone who
  has played with a garden hose - if you pinch the hose, less water comes out.
  If you pinch the hose hard enough, <i>no</i> water comes out.

<p>As you might imagine from the water analogy, if the more resistance there is
the less current.  That is, the more constricted the pipe is, the less amount
of water that can flow through it.  

<p>Also notice that the voltage at the top
of the resistor will be less than the voltage a the bottom of the resistor.
This difference in voltage is called the <i>voltage drop</i> across the
resistor.  This is similar in the water analogy - when water is forced into a
narrow pipe, the water gets "squished" together at the narrow entrance, and the
pressure is greater there than after then end of the narrow region.

<p>Resistance is measured in "ohms", which are named after physicist Georg
Simon Ohm, who studied electrical resistance in the 1800s.

  <div class="info">
    <div>
    Reading resistance
    </div>
    <div>
<p>You can't tell how much resistance a resistor has by the size of it.  One
resistor that is exactly the same size and shape as another can have a million
or more times as much resistance.  Because of this, some resistors are labelled
with a color
code - a set of colored bands that indicate what the value of the resistance, in ohms.  The color code
matches a color with each of the digits 0-9:
  <table class="basic slim">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th><p>COLOR</p></th>
        <th><p>DIGIT</th>
      </tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:black; color:white;">BLACK</td> <td><p>0</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:BROWN; color:white;">BROWN</td> <td><p>1</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:RED; color:white;">RED</td> <td><p>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:ORANGE; color:white;">ORANGE</td> <td><p>3</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:YELLOW; color:gray;">YELLOW</td> <td><p>4</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:GREEN; color:white;">GREEN</td> <td><p>5</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:BLUE; color:white;">BLUE</td> <td><p>6</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:VIOLET; color:white;">VIOLET</td> <td><p>7</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:GRAY; color:white;">GRAY</td> <td><p>8</td></tr>
      <tr><td><p style="border-radius: 3px; padding: 5px; background:WHITE; color:black;">WHITE</td> <td><p>9</td></tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
<p><mark>Finish - color codes in a table, mnemonics.
    <p>As shown above, the first 2 bands of color are the first two digits of
    the resistance.  The third band is a 10-times multiplier - it is the number
    of zeros to add to the end of the number.
    <p>For example, for the resistor shown above, the color bands are brown, black,
    and red, which corresponds to the numbers 1, 0, and 2.  Therefore, the
    resistance is "10" followed by 2 zeros, which is 1000 ohms.

  <h1>Ohm's Law</h1>

<p>With the basic definitions of voltage, current and resistance in hand,
you're ready for one of the fundamental equations in circuit theory, Ohm's law:

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-size: 150%;">
<strong><i>Voltage</i></strong> = <strong><i>Current</i></strong> &middot; <strong><i>Resistance</i></strong>

<p>It says that, for
a component in a circuit, the voltage drop across that component is equal to
the current through that component times the Resistance of that component.
<p>Thinking about a constricted pipe in the water analogy, this makes a lot of
sense.  What it says is, for a given amount of resistance, if you increase the
voltage some percentage, the current will increase by the same percentage.  Or
in terms of water, if you increase the pressure some percentage, the water
current will increase by the same percentage.
<p>For example, for a given constriction in a pipe, if you pump twice as hard,
twice as much water will flow.
<p>A similar relationship is true for resistance:
    <p><mark>PIC: resistive circuits, with resistance changing</mark>
    <p>Assuming the pumping pressure stays constant, as the resistance
    increases (the pipe gets narrower), the current decreases by the same
    percentage.  For example, if the resistance doubled, the current would be
    half as much.
    <p>The same is true with electric circuits, and there are variable resistors
    (sometimes called potentiometers or "pots") that allow you to change the resistance in a circuit by turning a knob.
