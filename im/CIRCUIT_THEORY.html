  <h1>INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS</h1>
  <h2>Power, Load, Ground</h2>

  <p>In all circuits, we can talk about three parts of the circuit:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Power:</strong> This is generally the point of highest charge
      in your circuit -- for example, the positive terminal of your battery.
      This point in a circuit is sometimes generically called "Vcc" or in the
      case of the projects we'll be doing, "3.3V" (since the power source we'll
      be using will be 3.3 volts). The power source provides the energy that
      makes the circuit do something useful.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Load:</strong> The part of the circuit that uses the flow of
      charged particles -- the components in the circuit -- is typically
      referred to as the Load. Above we talked about circuit resistance -- the
      Load is the part of the circuit that provides resistance. An example from
      our earlier circuit would be the lightbulb -- that is a part of the
      circuit Load. The Load uses the energy that the power source
      provides.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Ground:</strong> In an electric circuit, Ground is generally
      the point of lowest charge in the circuit. For example, in our lightbulb
      circuit above, the negative terminal of the battery is the point of
      lowest charge, and would be the physical ground point of this circuit.
      Interestingly, the reason we use the term "Ground" is because in many
      electrical applications (like the electricity running through your
      house), the earth is used as both our reference point of lowest charge
      and our physical point of attaching the electrical circuit. This is
      because the earth is able to receive nearly infinite amounts of
      electricity without increasing its total charge, so we can always assume
      that the voltage between a power source and the earth will be
      constant.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

      Grounding Yourself
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>In our assembly guide, we mentioned that you should "ground" yourself
      before touching electronic components. Now that you have a conceptual
      idea of what ground is, we can explain this further. Have you ever gotten
      a static shock by touching someone or something? Sometimes, electric
      charge builds up in your body. This charge is then released -- in the
      form of a static discharge (or shock) when you touch someone or something
      that has a different amount of charge. In other words, if there is a
      voltage difference between you and some object, and you touch that
      object, you'll get a shock. Once your body has discharged the excess
      charge, you don't get any more shocks -- until, of course, you build up
      more charge.</p>

      <p>If you were to touch an electrical component when you have a charge
      built up in your body, that resulting static shock that you feel could
      very well be enough to zap the component and break it (we sometimes call
      this "frying the component.") So, to avoid frying any electrical
      components, we recommend that you discharge any excess charge in your
      body before touching the components.</p>

      <p>You can ground yourself by touching any piece of metal that is
      connected via some relatively direct path to the earth. Since all the
      electrical outlets in your house are connected to the earth, you can
      generally ground yourself by touching the metal case of a electrical
      device that is plugged in. On the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, you can
      touch the metal casing on any of the USB ports or the Ethernet port on
      the back of the Raspberry Pi -- assuming the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit is
      plugged into a wall outlet.</p>
