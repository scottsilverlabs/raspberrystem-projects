  <h1>Voltage, Current & Resistance</h1>
  <p>These three concepts define how and when electric charge flows, and
  controlling these things allows us to harness the power that
  electricity
  provides. While we canâ€™t actually see voltage, current or resistance, there
  are some analogies we can use to help understand what each of these concepts
  are and how they interact with each other.</p>

    <mark>PIC: Battery resistive circuit vs water resistive circuit</mark>
    <p>Similar to the previous example, the Battery/Pump forces
    Electrons/Water around a closed loop (circuit).  But we've now added a
    conscriction to the pipe so we can discuss additional elements of the
    circuit:

  <h2>Voltage</h2>

    <mark>PIC: Battery vs water circuits, with low/high voltage/pressure highlighted</mark>
  <p>Voltage is essentially the difference in the amount of charge from one
  point in a circuit to another. An important electrical concept is that
  charge will typically only flow between two points that have a difference in
  charge (a voltage). Specifically, charged particles will flow from a point of
  higher charge to a point of lower charge. If there is the same amount of
  charge at two points in a circuit, no electric charge will flow.</p>

  <p>Using our water analogy, voltage is analogous to the amount of pressure
  (basically, the force) that there is pushing water through a pipe filled with
  water. Imagine a water system that contains a water pump that is pushing
  water around a loop of a water-filled pipe (a 'circuit') -- water enters the
  pump at a low pressure and is forced out of the pump at a high pressure. It
  is this pressure difference that generates the flow of water. Likewise in an
  electric circuit, the electric power source is analogous to the water pump --
  a power source takes in charge at a low voltage and pushes it out at a high
  voltage. It is this difference in voltage on the opposite sides of of the
  power source that generates the flow of charged particles.</p>

    <p>Whenever there is a difference in voltages from one point to another in
    a circuit, and there is a conductive path for the electrons to flow between
    those two two points, the electrons will flow.  This is true for forces in
    general - if you push someone else, they have to push back with the same
    amount of force, or else they will move.  The person who pushes with more
    force continues to move in the direction of that force.

<p>Finally, voltage are (virtually) always talked about between two points.
That is, we always discuss a voltage <i>difference</i> between those two
points.  For example, if you've
every measured the voltage of a battery, you have to measure the voltage
<i>difference</i> between the negative and positive sides.  However, it is
generally common to just discuss voltages at a single point in a circuit.  This
is because it is <i>assumed</i> that you are asking for the voltage difference
between that point and <i>ground</i>, which is generally the lowest point of
volatge in a circuit.  We'll discuss <i>ground</i> more in later projects.

  <h2>Current</h2>

    <mark>PIC: Battery vs water circuits, with constant current highlighted</mark>
  <p>Current is the flow of electric charge through a
  circuit. Using our water analogy, 
  current is the amount of water actually flowing through the
  pipe.  In both cases, its measured by the amount of stuff (electrons or
  water) that flows through the pipe in an amount of time.</p>

    <p>Its important to note that in our simple circuit example above, the
  current is exactly the same at every point in the circuit.  That is, if your
  were to look at any small segment of the circuit, the same amount of
  electrons are going into that segment as are going out.  This is true in the
  battery, the wires, and the resistor.

  <p>If you think about the water analogy, you might realize this must be true.
  If there was any segment of the circuit where there was more water going into
  that circuit than going out, then the pipe would ballon up at that point, or
  burst.  But that doesn't happen - the flow of current happens around the
  entrie circuit all together, in lock step.

  <h2>Resistance</h2>
    <mark>PIC: Two water resistive circuits, with different resistances</mark>
  <p>If a water pipe is contricted (pinched), then less water can flow through it (for a certain water pressure).  This concept is familiar to anyone who has played with a garden hose - if you pinch the hose, less water comes out.  If you pinch the hose hard enough, <i>no</i> water comes out.

<p>As you might imagine from the water analogy, if the more resistance there is
the less current.  That is, the more constricted the pipe is, the less amount
of water that can flow through it.  <p>Also notice that the voltage at the top
of the resistor will be less than the voltage a the bottom of the resistor.
This difference in voltage is called the <i>voltage drop</i> across the
resistor.  This is similar in the water analogy - when water is forced into a
narrow pipe, the water gets "squished" together at the narrow entrance, and the
pressure is greater there than after then end of the narrow region.
