<h1>GENERAL PURPOSE INPUT/OUTPUT (GPIO)</h1>

<p>The purpose of this concept is to discuss one of the most important aspects of 
integrating your electronics hardware and your code.  The concepts we will present here
should explain how your code can "communicate" with your circuit and how your circuit
can "communicate" with your code.

<h2>GPIOs as Outputs</h2>

<p>If you recall from our earlier discussion in 
<a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS</a>, electric current will 
only flow through a circuit when there is a voltage differential between the beginning and 
the end of the circuit.</p>
<p>This is why, for our basic LED circuit, the LED will illuminate when we attach one side 
of the circuit to 3.3V power and the other side to ground.  Like this:</p>

<br>

<img style="height: 350px; width: 150px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png">
</center>
<br>

<p>Given that, it should also make sense that, if there is no voltage differential between 
the beginning and the end of a circuit, no current will flow.  For example, imagine our 
circuit above, but instead of attaching the end of the circuit to ground, we attach it to 
3.3V power, just like the beginning of the circuit.</p>
<p>The circuit would look like this:</p>

<br>
<center>
<img style="height: 350px; width: 240px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO-as-Power.png">
</center>
<br>

<p>And as you can probably guess, no current would flow and the LED would not illuminate.</p>

<p>Now, imagine that we wire a circuit where the end of the circuit has a switch.  And that 
switch can be toggled between connecting to power and connecting to ground.  It might look 
a little something like this:</p>
 
<br>
<center>
<img style="height: 375px; width: 250px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO_Switch1.png">
</center>
<br>

<p>Based on what we discussed above, it should be clear that when the switch is toggled 
to power, no current will flow through the circuit.  And when the switch is toggled to 
ground, current will flow through the circuit:</p>

<br>
<table style="width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 375px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO_Switch2.png" align="top"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 375px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO_Switch3.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPIO Attached To Power (LED Off)<br>
</span></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPIO Attached to Ground (LED On)<br>
</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>

<p>When the circuit is configured like the left-hand circuit above, no current is flowing 
and the LED does not illuminate.  But, when the circuit is configured like the right-hand 
circuit above, current will flow and the LED will illuminate.</p>

<p>It turns out that there is a component that does exactly this, and it's part of the 
Raspberry Pi.  Using software, we can control how the switch is toggled, and we can force 
a physical connection to either power or ground.  This component is called a General Purpose 
Input/Output (GPIO).  And this is one way computers allow us to control hardware through 
software.</p>

<p>Here is a schematic representation of a GPIO:</p>
 
<br>
<center>
<img style="height: 355px; width: 260px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO.png">
</center>
<br>

<p>But remember, what's going on inside that GPIO box is what we represented above -- 
it is essentially a switch that can be toggled to power or to ground, allowing circuit 
to either not flow (when toggled to power) or to flow (when toggled to ground).</p>

<br>
<div class="info">
<div>"Active Low"</div>
<div>
<p>
In the electronics world, we often use the term "low" to refer to ground.  You might hear 
an engineer say something like, "Tie that component low," or "Set that pin low."  That 
simply means to connect whatever is being referred to to ground.
</p>
<p>
It's interesting -- and sometimes confusing -- to think about the fact that when a GPIO 
is set low (attached to ground), the current is flowing and the circuit is working.  And 
when a GPIO is set high (attached to power), current stops flowing.  We tend to think of 
something working when it's attached to power, not ground.  But remember, the other side
of the circuit is still attached to power, and it's the differential that creates the
current flow.
</p>
<p>
This is why you'll sometimes hear engineers use the term "Active Low."  It indicates 
that the GPIO needs to be set low (to ground) for the circuit to be active.

<h2>What Do GPIOs Look Like?</h2>
<p>GPIOs are specific pins (little metal "legs"
on the bottom or sides of a computer chip) that provide a connection
between a physical circuit and the software inside the chip.
We
make these connections to the computer chip available on the
RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit by plugging wires into the
Lid Connector Board holes.
GPIOs are like the
nerve-system of the platform â€“ their job is to relay signals from
the brain (the Raspberry Pi computer) to the muscles (the components
of the circuit) and to take signals from the muscles and relay them
back to the brain. </p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi has 26 GPIOs, and each one can be set to act
as an input (it can take a
signal from an external device and relay it to the Raspberry Pi) or 
an output (it can relay a signal from the Raspberry Pi to
an external device).</p>
<p>GPIOs are referenced by number (for example,
GPIO17), and each pin (hole) on the Lid Connector Board is labeled with the
GPIO it is connected to.  So, if you want to hook up a
component to GPIO17, you'll insert a wire from the component to the
hole on the Lid Connector Board labled "17".</p>
<br>
<div class="info">
<div>GPIOs Come From the Raspberry Pi</div>
<div>
<p>The Lid Connector Board was designed to make connecting to the
Raspberry Pi pins cleaner and easier. In fact, the whole purpose of the
ribbon cable and the Lid Connector Board is simply to bring the GPIO
pins (and
other pins) from the Raspberry Pi to the RaspberrySTEM 
Lid, where they
are easier for you to attach your components to.
</p>
<p>
But, if you
had a Raspberry Pi computer without the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, you'd still
be able to get access to the Raspberry Pi GPIOs. The GPIOs are made
available through the pins on the Raspberry Pi
(the pins that the ribbon cable is attached to).  If you were to
remove the ribbon cable, you could connect wires
directly to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins and attach them to the breadboard (or
to your components) directly.
