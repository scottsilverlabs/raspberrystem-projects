<h1>GENERAL PURPOSE INPUT/OUTPUT (GPIO)</h1>

<p>The purpose of this concept is to discuss one of the most important aspects of 
integrating your electronics hardware with your code.  Specifically, we will explain
how your code can "control" your circuit (GPIOs as Outputs) and how your circuit can 
"communicate" with your code (GPIOs as Inputs).  

<h2>Introduction to GPIOs</h2>

<p>In the early RaspberrySTEM projects, we wrote some basic code to print text to our Output Window
and we built some simple circuits to light up an LED.  While doing these types of projects
is important to learn the basics of programming and electronics, the purpose of this kit -- and
the part of programming and electronics that's really fun and interesting -- is getting your code 
and your electronics to work together.</p>

<p>In general, there are two ways that your code and your circuits can work together:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Your software (code) can control your hardware (circuits);</li>
	<li><p>Your hardware (circuits) can communicate with your software (code).
</ol>

<img style="width: 450px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO1.jpg">

<p>The most common use for having your software control your hardware is to turn components 
on and off (like an LED or any other device that can turn on/off).  And the most common
use for having your hardware communicate with your software is to indicate that an event has 
occurred (like a button being pressed).</p>

<p>Understanding how this communication and control is implemented is the key to being able to develop 
software and hardware that work together to build valuable and interesting devices.  As it turns
out, there is a relatively simple mechanism for how to get our circuits and our code to work together, and it's
called General Purpose Input/Output, or "GPIO" for short.  GPIOs sit between your 
circuit and your software, and allow the two to interact:</p>

<img style="width: 450px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO2.jpg">

<p>In the next section, we'll give a brief overview of what GPIOs physically are, and then after that,
we'll talk about how they work and how you can use them in your projects.  Then, we'll use these 
concepts in most of our future projects.</p>

<h2>What Are GPIOs?</h2>
<p>GPIOs are specific pins (little metal "legs"
on the bottom or sides of a computer chip) that provide a connection
between a physical circuit and the software inside the chip.
We
make these connections to the computer chip available on the
RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit by plugging wires into the
Lid Connector Board holes.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi has 26 GPIOs, each of which are referenced by number (for example,
GPIO17), and each pin (hole) on the Lid Connector Board is labeled with the
GPIO it is connected to.  So, if you want to hook up a
component to GPIO17, you'll insert a wire from the component to the
hole on the Lid Connector Board labeled "17".<p>

<div class="info">
<div>GPIOs Come From the Raspberry Pi</div>
<div>
<p>The Lid Connector Board was designed to make connecting to the
Raspberry Pi pins cleaner and easier. In fact, the whole purpose of the
ribbon cable and the Lid Connector Board is simply to bring the GPIO
pins (and
other pins) from the Raspberry Pi to the RaspberrySTEM 
Lid, where they
are easier for you to attach your components.
</p>
<p>
But, if you
had a Raspberry Pi computer without the RaspberrySTEM CREATOR Kit, you'd still
be able to get access to the Raspberry Pi GPIOs. The GPIOs are made
available through the pins on the Raspberry Pi
(the pins that the ribbon cable is attached to).  If you were to
remove the ribbon cable, you could connect wires
directly to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins and attach them to your components
directly.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>How Do GPIOs Work</h2>

<p>While GPIOs all look the same, there are actually two different ways that they can be used
in your electronics projects.  We discussed above that there are two important uses for
GPIOs -- allowing your software to control your hardware and allowing your hardware to 
communicate with your software:</p>

<img style="width: 450px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO2.jpg">

<p>A GPIO can do either of these two things, but (generally) not at the same time.  You must decide beforehand
whether a GPIO is going to be used to allow software to control hardware or whether it will be 
used to allow hardware to communicate with software.  Once you make that decision, you will
"configure" the GPIO to perform that task.  By configure, we just mean that you will write a tiny
bit of code that tells the GPIO which of the two functions it will perform.</p>

<p>When we configure a GPIO to allow software to control hardware, we say that we're "using the GPIO
as an output":</p>

<img style="width: 450px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO3.jpg">

<p>And when we configure a GPIO to allow hardware to communicate with software, we say that we're
"using the GPIO as an input":</p>

<img style="width: 450px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO4.jpg">

<p>Now that we have a basic definition of GPIOs and how they can be used as either 
outputs or as inputs, let's talk in more detail about how GPIOs work in each of
these situations.</p>

<h3>GPIOs as Outputs</h3>

<p>The first part of our discussion will focus on how your code can control your 
circuit.  To understand this concept, we'll need to 
think back to a previous discussion about how and why electric current flows through
a circuit.</p>
<p>If you recall from our earlier discussion in 
<a href="INTRO_TO_ELECTRONICS.html">INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS</a>, electric current will 
only flow through a circuit when there is a voltage difference between the beginning and 
the end of the circuit.</p>
<p>This is why, for our basic LED circuit, the LED will illuminate when we attach one side 
of the circuit to 3.3V power and the other side to ground.  Like this:</p>

<img style="height: 350px; width: 150px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png">

<p>Given that, it should also make sense that, if there is no voltage difference between 
the beginning and the end of a circuit, no current will flow.  For example, imagine our 
circuit above, but instead of attaching the end of the circuit to ground, we attach it to 
3.3V power, just like the beginning of the circuit.</p>
<p>The circuit would look like this:</p>

<img style="height: 350px; width: 240px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO-as-Power.png">

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  The symbol at the bottom of the image above is just another way to indicate power in a schematic -- this is how power is typically represented when it's at the bottom
of a circuit.</p>
<p>As you can probably guess, in the circuit above, no current would flow through 
and the LED would not illuminate.</p>

<p>Now, imagine that we wire a circuit -- similar to above -- but where the bottom of the circuit has a switch.  And, that 
switch can be toggled between connecting to power and connecting to ground:</p>

<table style="width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 375px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO_Switch2.png" align="top"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 375px;" alt="" src="img/GPIO_Switch3.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"><strong>GPIO Attached To Power (LED Off)
</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"><strong>GPIO Attached to Ground (LED On)
</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Based on what we discussed earlier, it should be clear that when the circuit is 
configured like the left-hand circuit above, no current is flowing 
and the LED does not illuminate.  But, when the circuit is configured like the right-hand 
circuit above, current will flow and the LED will illuminate.</p>

<p>This is conceptually how a GPIO works.  Using software, we can set the GPIO
to either power or ground.</p>

<p>Here is a schematic representation of a GPIO within a circuit:</p>
 
<img style="height: 355px; width: 260px;" alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO.png">

<div class="info">
<div>"Active Low"</div>
<div>
<p>
In the electronics world, we often use the term "low" to refer to ground.  You might hear 
an engineer say something like, "Tie that component low," or "Set that pin low."  That 
simply means to connect the component/pin to ground.
</p>
<p>
It's interesting -- and sometimes confusing -- to think about the fact that in the circuits above, when the GPIO 
is set low (attached to ground), current is flowing and the LED is illuminated.  And 
when the GPIO is set high (attached to power), current stops flowing.  We tend to think of 
current flowing when it's attached to power, not ground.  But remember, the other side
of the circuit is still attached to power, and it's the voltage difference that creates
current flow.
</p>
<p>
This is why you'll sometimes hear engineers use the term "Active Low."  It indicates 
that the GPIO needs to be set low (to ground) for the circuit to be active (turned on).
</p>

<h3>GPIOs as Inputs</h3>

<p>The first part of our GPIO discussion focused on how we could control our circuit from
our code (GPIO as Outputs).  This part of our discussion will focus on how our circuit 
can communicate with our code.  This is important because we often want to trigger our code 
to do certain things or take certain actions based on input or changes coming from our 
circuit.</p>

<p>For example, our code could count
the number of times a button is pressed in a short a period of time -- if the 
button is pressed once, have our code do one thing and if the button is 
pressed twice, have our code do something else.  In 
this way, we've added "intelligence" to our button presses. When our hardware can 
communicate directly with our code, we open a world of possibilities.</p>

<p>So, how do we do this?  By using GPIOs in inputs.  Much like GPIO outputs work by 
simply setting a voltage on 
the GPIO pin to either ground (0V) or power (3.3V), GPIO inputs work by reading the 
voltage -- either 0V or 3.3V -- being sent to the GPIO pin by the attached
component.
</p>

<p>For example, a GPIO can be used to get the current state of a button or switch
(pressed or released). Based on the current state, the software can do what we expect 
when the button/switch is in that state. </p>


<div class="info">
<div>"State"</div>
<div>
<p>"State" is a common term used in electronics and just means
the current condition or situation of a component or circuit.

For
example, in the case of a button or switch, state would refer to
whether the button is currently being pressed or released.
 For
an LED, state might refer to whether the LED was illuminated or not.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>For a component to communicate with our code, instead of wiring the component directly 
into the rest of the circuit, we instead wire the component directly to a GPIO.  Typically,
a component wired to a GPIO input would either generate 0V or 3.3V and the GPIO input would
read that voltage and communicate it to our code -- hence the code knows about the "state"
of the component.

<p>Buttons are a little bit different, as they don't generate a voltage.  But, with a little
bit of behind-the-scenes configuration, we can wire a circuit so that our button can be used
as a GPIO input and we can read the state of the button based on the voltages generated.</p>

<p>This is what the schematic would look like for a button wired to a GPIO as an input:</p>

<img class=schematic style="max-width:600px;" src="img/Pushbutton-to-GPIO.png">

<p>
This circuit works by defaulting the GPIO voltage to 3.3V (that's the behind-the-scenes configuration we mentioned above, but not shown in the schematic).  When the button is unpressed 
(circuit open), the GPIO reads the default 3.3V.  When the button is pressed, the circuit
is closed, the GPIO gets pulled low (to ground), and will read 0V.  This way, the code can 
measure the voltage at the GPIO and know if the button is pressed (0V at GPIO) or unpressed
(3.3V at GPIO).</p>
