Note on the Text Tool:
    - The Text Tool (Text with Arrow Leader), sometimes loses the text when the
      Leader is "View based", when the image is exported.  To fix this, Leave
      the Leader as "Pushpin".
    - Whenever you move the text around, or reorient the scene camera, you must:
        - Move the text
        - Change the Leader to View based
        - Change the Leader to Pushpin
